     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s something about the kind of potent rock and roll fury that &lt;strong&gt;Airbourne&lt;/strong&gt; cranks out, all cylinders firing, that makes you want to chug a beer straight down your throat and punch the air as though it&amp;rsquo;d touched your wife inappropriately. It sounds crude, we admit. But that&amp;rsquo;s the thing about these Aussie pub rock rebels. Their music, like new album &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Guts. No Glory.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; are perfect soundtracks for drunken debauchery, and &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re here for, mate,&amp;rdquo; says rowdy lead guitarist and vocalist &lt;strong&gt;Joel O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the likes of Judas Priest, Thin Lizzy, Angel City, Rose Tattoo, AC/DC and Motorhead, Airbourne have been waving the rock and roll flag for Australia since 2003, and in the process, winning fans and awards, like the one they took home in 2008 from the Metal Hammer Golden Gods, where the band&amp;rsquo;s album &lt;em&gt;Runnin&amp;rsquo; Wild&lt;/em&gt; was named the year&amp;rsquo;s Best Debut Album. They hail from Warrnambool, a small drinking town on the southwestern coast of Victoria, Australia, and they&amp;rsquo;ve steadily gained an immense following among fans of infectious, high energy, whiskey-soaked, whiplash-inducing working man&amp;rsquo;s rock. The band&amp;rsquo;s new album is a mandatory addition to any self-respecting jukebox&amp;rsquo;s library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Basically, we&amp;rsquo;ve never been about having a specific message; we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about politics or social injustices in our songs. There are other bands out there to take care of that,&amp;rdquo; says Joel O&amp;lsquo;Keeffe, who, like brother and Airbourne drummer &lt;strong&gt;Ryan O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe&lt;/strong&gt;, has been playing guitar since he could walk. &amp;ldquo;With us, it&amp;rsquo;s not like that. It&amp;rsquo;s just rock and roll. We want people to have a good time, no matter what. Have a drink, play it really loud, and kick back.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airbourne traveled to the Windy City to record &lt;em&gt;No Guts. No Glory.&lt;/em&gt; with producer &lt;strong&gt;Johnny K&lt;/strong&gt;, who has worked with Disturbed, Machine Head, Staind, and 3 Doors Down, among others. Like &lt;em&gt;Runnin&amp;rsquo; Wild&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;No Guts. No Glory.&lt;/em&gt; continues that good time vibe, but ultimately, according to Ryan, the record is about &amp;ldquo;standing up and going for it, and being a man. There&amp;rsquo;s a tougher element to the album, so to speak.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of sleeping every night in a comfortable hotel room bed on the label&amp;rsquo;s dime, the band actually slept in the studio, taking inspiration from Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band, who were known to live in the studio until an album was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We found out that they used to do that for the first bunch of records they did,&amp;rdquo; Joel explains, &amp;ldquo;so, the drums were set up in a big room with the guitars and [rhythm guitarist &lt;strong&gt;David Roads&lt;/strong&gt;], he slept behind the amps; I slept behind a bunch of amps; Ryan slept behind his drum kit and [bassist &lt;strong&gt;Justin Street&lt;/strong&gt;] slept behind this pool table, and we were all in the studio. It was really fun, because you&amp;rsquo;d just get up and go, &amp;lsquo;Fuck,&amp;rsquo; and start recording. That&amp;rsquo;s how your day was. You just sort of woke up, had some food, and started recording. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d have a shower; maybe not. Just sort of walk around in your shorts all day, just rocking away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Guts. No Glory&lt;/em&gt;., the band&amp;rsquo;s second LP for &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt;, was recorded live and straight to analog tape, and Airbourne essentially used the acoustics of the recording space as an impromptu instrument. &amp;ldquo;Instead of closing all the doors and keeping the sound all confined, we just left everything open, so the sound would bleed a bit more, so it sounds a bit more open than the last one,&amp;rdquo; Joel explained. &amp;ldquo;That was one of the main differences. We just let it be open. We didn&amp;rsquo;t care if the guitar solo bled through the bloody cymbal mikes. It&amp;rsquo;s cool, because it adds to it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album&amp;rsquo;s a virtual rock and roll buffet, boasting tracks like &amp;ldquo;No Way But The Hard Way&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Blond, Bad and Beautiful.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; When the band lived together for three years on welfare in a Melbourne suburb, surviving on a steady diet of booze and barbecue, things were tough, and the band nearly burned their home to the ground- literally. &amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Nothing came easy, and we&amp;rsquo;d say to each other, &amp;lsquo;Ain&amp;rsquo;t no way but the hard way,&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; recalls Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Guts. No Glory. &lt;/em&gt;also features a song called &amp;ldquo;Steel Town,&amp;rdquo; which was inspired by the band&amp;rsquo;s time on the road, and some of the people they had encountered. &amp;ldquo;Every time we went through a town that was a steel town, there was something about the crowd themselves,&amp;rdquo; recalls Joel O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe. &amp;ldquo;They seemed to be a little bit wilder, and they&amp;rsquo;d always drink the pub dry, and we&amp;rsquo;d have to get more beer from other pubs. There was always a massive fight, always a crazy crowd. So we wanted to give them a song that gives them a chance to raise their flag and pump their fists in the air, and drink a beer to it. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s like throwing gasoline on the fire.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airbourne will be touring for much of 2010 in support of &lt;em&gt;No Guts. No Glory.&lt;/em&gt; and for the O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe brothers, it&amp;rsquo;s the band&amp;rsquo;s live performance that brings folks coming back for more. &amp;ldquo;We want to become that band that, people hear the name, and they know that they&amp;rsquo;ll have a good time at the show,&amp;rdquo; Joel explains. &amp;ldquo;They know what they&amp;rsquo;re going to get. They&amp;lsquo;re going to get rock and roll, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to be loud, and they&amp;rsquo;ll leave the concert with their ears ringing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&apos;s an excitement here you can&apos;t get with other bands. We take what we do seriously; nail you with modern thrash elements but still pull some fuckin&apos; weird shit out of our heads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baptized In Blood guitarist Josh Torrance doesn&apos;t jest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenced by everything from Gothenburg to glam&amp;mdash;as long as it&apos;s distorted&amp;mdash;this London, Ontario-based five-piece runs the metallic gamut, creating a sound that is technically-inspired yet groove oriented and anthemnic in the same throw. Baptized In Blood are keepers of a sonic singularity that has established them as one of modern metal&apos;s most forthright, furious and frenetic heavy music bands to date, an aural prowess and thunderous dominance perfectly encapsulated on the band&apos;s sophomore effort/Roadrunner Records debut &lt;em&gt;Baptized In Blood&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A collection of ravenously obliterating yet sonically masterful and provocative tunes,&lt;em&gt;Baptized In Blood &lt;/em&gt;assures that while these men may only have just over a half-decade of experience under their belts, those countless hours of rehearsals, refinement and devastating performances (blood, sweat and tears) are never in vain. It prods one to wonder exactly how a band poised to realign the state of Great White metal forms in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Boredom,&amp;rdquo; chuckles Fendley, noting how the absence of distraction&amp;mdash;namely one particular sport circa 2004&amp;mdash;resulted in a unified commitment to decimate the barriers of metal. &amp;ldquo;It was actually by chance. We were talking at the bar about how we should start a band since there was no hockey that year. Everybody piped up about the parts they wanted to do and it was done. We started writing songs and playing shows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately packing venues thanks to both their unadulterated girth and various foundations in the local scene, Baptized In Blood quickly became a formidable endeavour. Issuing both an independent EP and full-length in expedient succession garnered the band an even stronger fan base, with the quintet&apos;s sincerity, hard work and endurance eventually commanding the attention of Roadrunner Records, a home where Baptized In Blood&apos;s diversity and devotion has resulted in their explosive eponymous affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that extent, &lt;em&gt;Baptized In Blood&lt;/em&gt; finds its namesake outfit striving to offer newfound grace, attitude and attack to metal via the aforementioned spirited enthusiasm and borderline-dichotomous influences. Heavily inspired by diverse aspects of thrash metal, punk and classic rock, &lt;em&gt;Baptized In Blood&lt;/em&gt; offers a hard edge bolstered by both communicable melodies and outright pummeling amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are the straight-up screamers who take it very seriously and have that tough guy, &apos;I&apos;m gonna try to kill you&apos; atmosphere in their music,&amp;rdquo; notes Torrance. &amp;ldquo;But you have the opposite end of the spectrum where bands play the same type of stuff but have the extremely clean singing. We&apos;re right in the middle of that. Johl&apos;s screaming his ass off the entire time but you hear the melody. It&apos;s just as dirty either way though. As for the guitars, we&apos;re modern thrash but once again, a bit of glam inspiration infuses that excitement and flare.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Either way, it&apos;s all about the metal,&amp;rdquo; Fendley interjects. &amp;ldquo;If I had just raspy vocals the whole time, we&apos;d be slotted with thrash but if I was only guttural, we&apos;d be death metal. I move between all of that so we can&apos;t be pinned down. Baptized In Blood adapts to its surroundings because these songs are for us; what we want to hear. We can&apos;t be lumped into specific sub-genres because we could write a power ballad and it would still be Baptized.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring their vision was documented to perfection, Baptized In Blood enlisted the assistance of producer/engineer Zeuss (Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Chimaira) for the 15 songs that comprise their inaugural Roadrunner exhibition. Welcoming the band into his Hadley, Massachusetts-based Planet Z Studio, the legendary mastermind set about pulling out Baptized In Blood&apos;s inherently guttural crunch, overt vigor and virulence while still allowing their own modus to tear through to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He really worked us hard,&amp;rdquo; groans Torrance wryly while noting how&lt;em&gt; Baptized In Blood&lt;/em&gt; benefits from broader dynamics, emotion and comprehensive grit thanks to the collaborative effort. &amp;ldquo;It&apos;s more serious overall but it also has a fun vibe to it. It&apos;s one of those records that someone just getting into metal would think is awesome; get out and party to. At the same time a veteran would do the exact same thing &apos;cause it&apos;s uplifting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&apos;re a metal band working with a legendary hardcore producer,&amp;rdquo; adds Fendley enthusiastically. &amp;ldquo;That gave us the inspiration to kick it up a notch. None of us were accepting second best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that extent, both Fendley and Torrance relate that &lt;em&gt;Baptized In Blood &lt;/em&gt;is easily the band&apos;s most cohesive work to date, propelled by motivation not only to excel but as Fendley notes, an acute history of personal affairs that drive the album to emotional extremes and in turn, engage the music to become harder, faster and inherently catchier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Everything I sing about, I&apos;ve gone through. I&apos;ve lived through this and write about what I know, not zombies, murder or anything like that. Everyday life motivates me. A lot of people go through what I have, so I try to keep a positive outlook on life because you alone have the choice of being pissed off or making the best of things. My message is that I&apos;ve been there too so maybe I can help you out. We&apos;re all in this together. As for this album, it&apos;s a step in a darker direction but still trying to keep my head above the clouds; relieving stresses we as people are going through and asking questions. It&apos;s a battle cry: is anybody with me? Does anybody go through this crap too?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compelled by &lt;em&gt;Baptized In Blood&lt;/em&gt;&apos;s rabid, ravenous and re-invigorating assault, Fendley&apos;s answer will come with resounding affirmation. Not only do we metallions relate to his lyrics but as this incensed, metal masterpiece unfolds, we are congenitally coerced into action. It&apos;s a state even Baptized In Blood themselves are unable to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This album is the result of a lot of hard work,&amp;rdquo; declares Fendley. &amp;ldquo;We followed a dream and after six years we&apos;re at the starting point to really make this work. This album may be completed...but now it&apos;s time for us to really start busting ass.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Billy Talent singer Ben Kowalewicz has been front and centre in one of the greatest Canadian rock &amp;lsquo;n&apos; roll success stories of the post-millennial era. The normally hyperactive front man is betraying neither cockiness nor complacency as he candidly assesses what might await the group in the summer of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go back and listen to the chorus of &quot;Try Honesty, &quot;the monster single that broke Billy Talent and its eponymous debut album wide to the tune of triple-platinum sales in Canada back in 2003, and you&apos;ll remind yourself instantly that this band had the chops on delivery to stick around much longer than the mall-ready &quot;pop-punk&quot; fetish with which it was in some quarters initially, mistakenly associated. Instant chart success can be a bitch, though, and it was only after Billy Talent demonstrated its lasting mettle in the wake of 2006&apos;s Billy Talent II with three more platinum sales awards, a sold-out show at Toronto&apos;s 20,000-seat Air Canada Centre and, most unexpectedly, a No. 1 debut in Germany to match the one already notched at home that most reasonable folks from these parts finally woke up to the fact that they&apos;d been sleeping on a &quot;real deal&quot; in their midst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy TalentBilly Talent is past all that, for the most part. Kowalewicz, guitarist Ian D&apos;Sa, bassist Jon Gallant and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk have been slogging away together for more than 15 years now and, consequently, have nothing to prove from a &quot;paying your dues&quot; standpoint. It would be nice nonetheless if the scorching Billy Talent III decisively hammered home to both the fans and the doubters what a shit-hot, world-dominating hard-rock band has grown out of these four former Mississauga teenagers&apos; shared high-school dreams of &amp;hellip; well &amp;hellip; growing into a shit-hot, world-dominating hard-rock band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We got a rough shake at the beginning, and then, I think, people started really understanding our band,&quot; says D&apos;Sa. That was something that happened in the early years because, when a new band comes out, in the public&apos;s eyes, they need to be poked and prodded with &amp;lsquo;Where&apos;s this band really coming from?&apos; I think people just got to understand us and now we don&apos;t have those problems that much anymore.&quot; Billy Talent is fairly oozing good songs on Billy Talent III, and for the first time they&apos;ve all made it to tape in pretty much the same form they&apos;d be heard during one of the breathless live shows that initially, decisively established and have since cemented the band&apos;s name and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy TalentFor this, some thanks are due &amp;ndash; if Billy Talent can be permitted a bit of uncharacteristic name-dropping &amp;ndash; to producer Brendan O&apos;Brien, who found time amidst a heroically busy schedule that recently added Bruce Springsteen and AC/DC to a list of superstar credits begun with Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots to come north to Toronto and man the boards for the BTIII sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band never actually thought itself worthy of working with someone who&apos;d shaped the sound of so many of its members&apos; agreed-upon &quot;formative&quot; records. Nevertheless, when asked by attentive record-label folk to submit a list of &quot;dream&quot; producers for the new album, the boys gamely responded with one that placed O&apos;Brien at the top, then shared a good chuckle over their hopeless ambitions and simply proceeded under the assumption that D&apos;Sa would be picking up where he left off after quite capably co-producing the second Billy Talent LP alongside Gavin Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was our first choice but we didn&apos;t think that he&apos;d ever want to work with a band like us,&quot; says a still slightly boggled D&apos;Sa, who traces the group&apos;s collective admiration for O&apos;Brien back to his work on two of the Rage Against the Machine records. &quot;They just sound phenomenal. They have these huge drum sounds, great guitar tones, the songs are all great &amp;ndash; he did an amazing job on those albums.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy Talent&quot;He engineered (the Red Hot Chili Peppers&apos;) Blood Sugar Sex Magik, too,&quot; adds Solowoniuk, &quot;which is going back to albums that shape you as musicians because that was one of them. That album blew me away. It blew all of us away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the first day of preproduction in Toronto, just him showing up here, in this room, was definitely kind of intimidating,&quot; concedes D&apos;Sa. &quot;We set a chair aside for him and wrote &amp;lsquo;Mr. O&apos;Brien&apos; on it. He didn&apos;t think it was funny.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, O&apos;Brien&apos;s involvement only wound up further coaxing Billy Talent in the meatier, more deliberately paced and oh-so-slightly &quot;classicist&quot; riff-rock direction with which it was already flirting on the nascent tunes for Billy Talent III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumbering, low-end-propelled behemoths such as &quot;Devil On My Shoulder,&quot; &quot;The Dead Can&apos;t Testify&quot; and &quot;Sudden Movements&quot; signal a marked departure from more customarily frenetic-but-melodic Billy Talent fare like &quot;Tears Into Wine&quot; and &quot;Turn Your Back&quot; (a pre-release teaser released to grateful radio audiences several months ago), unmistakably betraying a &amp;lsquo;70s AM-radio lineage shared with the early-&amp;lsquo;90s grunge that first compelled four future chart-toppers from suburban Toronto to take up their craft in earnest. Once Brendan O&apos;Brien was in the picture, it only made sense to keep going that way. He&apos;d helped cultivate their musical roots, after all; if they were intuitively going back to them on their own, this had to represent the closing of some kind of circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy Talent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We never really planned out anything, but I&apos;d been coming up with a couple of riffs here and there that were a little more on the &apos;70s-rock side and some of those riffs ended up being songs like &amp;lsquo;Devil On My Shoulder,&apos;&quot; says D&apos;Sa. &quot;And we just wanted to keep going, just let things happen organically and see what happens. There was no real, grand design to it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;At the time, we were all kind of listening to bands like Soundgarden and our favourite bands from the early &amp;lsquo;90s, all those grunge records. We kinda grew up in that generation, so I think that&apos;s where the influence kinda came from and it leaked into the music a little bit. You can hear it on the record. There&apos;s definitely a grunge-era influence on this record.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kowalewicz concurs: &quot;Just being musicians, you have allegiances when you grow up. We grew up in the early &amp;lsquo;90s, when all these amazing bands came out &amp;ndash; Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Jane&apos;s Addiction. All these amazing things, we grew up with, and as time progressed we explored punk &amp;ndash; the Clash, the Pistols and things like that. We explored that avenue and, I guess, over time, as a progression, you kinda revert to a time when things made the most sense. And, I think, the early &amp;lsquo;90s kinda shaped us and our psyches and who we are and why we even play music.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Billy Talent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the tunes eventually shook down, tacit endorsement by an A-list production whiz of O&apos;Brien&apos;s stature &quot;probably lit a bit of that fire under us,&quot; as Gallant puts it, to step things up in the songwriting and musicianship departments heading into the studio. You can hear it in the playing, for sure, which has never sounded as dynamic and liquid and as definitively the product of 15 years&apos; worth of dogged, sweaty, night-by-night toil as it does on Billy Talent III &amp;ndash; check how limber the rhythm section rolls on the fond Police homage &quot;Diamond On A Landmine&quot; &amp;ndash; and was, at O&apos;Brien&apos;s urging, largely tracked for the first time while Billy Talent bashed it all out in the studio while playing together in the same room. And you can hear it in the broadened emotional range the band demonstrates in slower numbers like the wrenching &quot;White Sparrows,&quot; an almost-ballad that, Kowalewicz will allow, &quot;grew into something pretty magical&quot; by the time recording had wrapped. Maybe because &amp;ndash; shhhh &amp;ndash; someone finally figured out how to get this notorious shrieker to actually sing a verse or two once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;People are always saying: &amp;lsquo;You sound so different from record to live.&apos; And some people really like the way the records sound, some people really like the live stuff,&quot; says Kowalewicz. &quot;So one thing that, I think, we really wanted to do was amalgamate both, so that it sounds really big and heavy but there&apos;s still, like, this feeling that&apos;s really visceral and alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mission accomplished. Billy Talent has never sounded more visceral, nor more alive than it does here. Nor more ready for the trans-continental rock-star close-up it&apos;s been threatening for a couple of records now. Heaven only knows we could use a few more hitmakers like these guys to remind us why we all cared about hits in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, the new noise rang like a Sunday morning church bell, calling on saints and sinners alike to free their minds and become part of the revolution. They came out of the Southern swamps, the California desert, the working class towns of the Midwest and all along the East Coast.&amp;nbsp; Loud guitars and larger than life drumming came together with storytelling poetry.&amp;nbsp; Rebel-ism gave birth to rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every few years or so, a special batch comes up from the ground, to serve as a beacon.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Black Stone Cherry&lt;/strong&gt; have arrived with their second Roadrunner Records release, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Folklore and Superstition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There is a mystique with folklore and superstition,&quot; says &lt;strong&gt;Black Stone Cherry&lt;/strong&gt; drummer John Fred Young. &quot;We&apos;re intrigued by and interested in history, roots and heritage, and we incorporate that into our songs.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to tell compelling stories and lyrical tales isn&apos;t the only thing that &lt;strong&gt;Black Stone Cherry&lt;/strong&gt; bring to the table. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Folklore and Superstition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; isn&apos;t just a Southern rock record. It&apos;s an American rock n&amp;rsquo; roll record.&amp;nbsp; The album is a timeless work by American pied pipers destined to take their music from the back roads of America to the four corners of the globe.&amp;nbsp; &quot;We are taking Southern tradition and giving a taste to the rest of the world,&quot; says bassist/vocalist Jon Lawhon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Stone Cherry&lt;/strong&gt; didn&apos;t stray too far away from home to record the album.&amp;nbsp; The band wrote all the songs in the infamous Practice House, an old farmhouse used by John Fred&amp;rsquo;s father and uncle to write Grammy winning albums for The Kentucky Headhunters.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A song like &amp;ldquo;Soul Creek&amp;rdquo; fills the room with its vintage arena rock sound yet was born where the band held bonfires around a creek across the country road. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band enlisted famed rock producer Bob Marlette (Ozzy, Shinedown, Quiet Riot) and headed to Nashville&amp;rsquo;s Blackbird Studios that has housed everyone from Kid Rock to The Raconteurs, just 85 miles from their hometown of Edmonton, Kentucky.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;We incorporated regional sounds into the mix throughout the album,&amp;rdquo; says Young.&amp;nbsp; The band used turkey calls, a banjo and a washtub basin, among other things.&amp;nbsp; Jon Lawhon recalls, &quot;I made a washtub bass out of a broom handle and nylon rope!&quot;&amp;nbsp; Clearly, the band shied away from absolutely nothing when it came time to explore and experiment. &quot;We didn&apos;t want to leave any door unopened while recording,&quot; says guitarist/vocalist Ben Wells. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitting the road in support of their 2006 self-titled debut helped inspire and direct &lt;strong&gt;Black Stone Cherry&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; worldview when it came time to write the new album. The band traveled extensively outside the United States during the tour cycle.&amp;nbsp; This allowed them to stretch their creative muscle with songs like &quot;Please Come In&quot; and &amp;ldquo;Sunrise&amp;rdquo; which show the band&apos;s growth and diversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This album has allowed us to dig deep into our roots,&quot; continues Young. &quot;It also shows our influences in the songwriting. Our band is a positive band and we try to write songs that are uplifting. We also have a big storytelling side to us which comes through on songs like &apos;Ghost of Floyd Collins&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Reverend Wrinkle.&amp;rsquo;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vocalist/guitarist Chris Robertson reflects on the process, saying, &amp;ldquo;Starting out as a band seven years ago, with high hopes and even bigger dreams, I honestly believe this record shows the experience of our past travels, and gives a hint of the future. It captures all the energy and heart that embody &lt;strong&gt;Black Stone Cherry&lt;/strong&gt;. We took some chances on this album and I believe that our fans will appreciate seeing the other sides of the band that they may or may not have known existed.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Wells comments on the band&amp;rsquo;s expansion of its sound and subject matter, saying &quot;The songwriting took on a life of its own, as the structures of the songs themselves have grown so much from touring. We have so much more to talk about and can apply the things we picked up musically.&amp;rdquo; He admits the band also kept the ladies in mind this time around, recalling, &amp;ldquo;On the last album, girls would come up to us and say, &apos;You have songs for guys, so where are our songs?&amp;rsquo;&amp;nbsp; So we have a song called &apos;You&apos; on this album, which is a timeless ballad.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The band&amp;rsquo;s family and friends are another influence. &quot;Long Sleeves&quot; is told from the viewpoint of a friend who took part in the battle of Mogadishu as featured in the film &amp;ldquo;Black Hawk Down,&amp;rdquo; while &quot;Things My Father Said&quot; is a ballad that hits home with people from all walks of life.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the eerie swagger of &amp;ldquo;The Key&amp;rdquo; to the tell tale rocker &amp;ldquo;Blind Man&amp;rdquo; to the triumphant stomp of the anthem &amp;ldquo;Soulcreek,&amp;rdquo; to the heartfelt message of &amp;ldquo;Peace Is Free,&amp;rdquo; Black Stone Cherry say the trick to Folklore and Superstition is simply brotherhood, family, friends and home; no more, no less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For further information, please contact Jessica Ricci or Amy Sciarretto at Roadrunner Records:&amp;nbsp; 212.274.7500, ricci@roardrunnerrecords.com, amy@roadrunnerrecords.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Orillia, Ontario&amp;rsquo;s Bleeker Ridge had a good seven years of dedicated rehearsals, songwriting and gigs before landing a dream record deal with Roadrunner Records Canada and cutting an album, &lt;em&gt;Small Town Dead&lt;/em&gt;, with legendary producer Bob Marlette (Shinedown, Default, Seether, Airbourne), chockfull of hooky hard rock anthems. That kind of woodshedding might not seem unusual, except the band formed when they were kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The melodic hard rock quartet is comprised of two sets of brothers &amp;mdash; lead singer Taylor Perkins 21; guitarist Cole Perkins, 19; guitarist Dan Steinke, 19; and drummer Dustin Steinke, 20 &amp;mdash; who met in 2003 at a local jam night in Lagoon City (pop. 3000).&amp;nbsp; They went from playing Joe Walsh and Jimi Hendrix covers to writing originals, which they released on two independent CDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the songs on their label debut, &lt;em&gt;Small Town Dead&lt;/em&gt;, recorded at Henson Studios in Hollywood and Bob&amp;rsquo;s home studio in Woodland Hills, California, shows a band whose musicianship and songwriting skills belie their years. Radio and arena ready, they include the riffy soulful title-track; confrontational opener &amp;ldquo;Easier Today;&amp;rdquo; heavier groove, &amp;ldquo;Sixteen Hours;&amp;rdquo; searing power ballad, &amp;ldquo;In Our Hands;&amp;rdquo; and sentimental stunner, &amp;ldquo;You Would&amp;rsquo;ve Liked It.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve always been more into songwriting than anything else, even when we were 13,&amp;rdquo; says Taylor. &amp;ldquo;When we&amp;rsquo;re writing songs, we&amp;rsquo;re always looking to say, &amp;lsquo;That&amp;rsquo;s cool,&amp;rsquo; and making the songs huge. We&amp;rsquo;re all about trying to come up with rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll songs that can still be melodic and heavy and touch people with the lyrics.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 12 songs on &lt;em&gt;Small Town Dead&lt;/em&gt; were penned by Bleeker Ridge, including four co-writes that started with the band, &amp;ldquo;In Our Hands;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Pick Me Up;&amp;rdquo; and gentler &amp;ldquo;Still Standing&amp;rdquo; with Dave Bassett (Shinedown, Sevendust); and southern-styled kicker, &amp;ldquo;Sick of You,&amp;rdquo; with Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Three years ago, we decided to write a song that we think we can hear on the radio,&amp;rdquo; recalls Dan.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;That song, &amp;lsquo;In Our Hands,&amp;rsquo; took a shape that we&amp;rsquo;d never thought about doing before. We sent it to Dave and he was like, &amp;lsquo;Holy shit.&amp;rsquo; We had like 16 different versions, but that was the song that changed the whole perspective of writing for us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Small Town Dead,&amp;rdquo; is the album&amp;rsquo;s first single and is a particularly personal lyric for Bleeker Ridge that resonates for anyone who grew up outside a big city. &amp;ldquo;From talking with friends and kids I meet, I find that being in a small town like mine, everyone has the same outlook &amp;mdash; there&amp;rsquo;s never anything to do,&amp;rdquo; Taylor explains. &amp;ldquo;You can go watch a movie, then go break things [laughs].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also a song for all those kids who have finally left school behind and aren&amp;rsquo;t looking forward to growing up and getting out in the real world. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Trust the words I am speaking / Don&amp;rsquo;t let it bring you down / &amp;lsquo;cause now we&amp;rsquo;re falling forward / Everyone tells me that the party&amp;rsquo;s over&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; Taylor sings in the inspirational anthem &amp;ldquo;From Now On.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wrote some beautiful words in &amp;ldquo;You Would Have Liked It,&amp;rdquo; lamenting the loss of a girlfriend, wife or loved one who is unable to share in life&amp;rsquo;s defining moments, a theme quite advanced for a 21-year-old that can definitely tug at people twice his age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these new songwriting skills &amp;mdash; something many people in the music industry were waiting for them to develop before they were willing to commit to the band &amp;mdash; Bob Marlette was excited to work with them. He had first seen Bleeker Ridge six years ago at a showcase in Toronto, but felt they needed to mature. Later, by sheer coincidence, he was producing a band whose management mentioned the new act on its roster &amp;mdash; Bleeker Ridge. He couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bob&amp;rsquo;s a legend,&amp;rdquo; says Dan. &amp;ldquo;Everything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever grown up listening to this guy&amp;rsquo;s had a part in doing. Just being around him makes you want to be a better musician.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Bleeker Ridge is itching to get out on the road, the obvious next step for four guys who made the most of small town dead and curbed the boredom by playing in a rock band. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s been five or six years of writing songs and it&amp;rsquo;s all been leading up to this moment of getting on the bus and just going for it,&amp;rdquo; says Dan. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what we live for &amp;ndash; playing shows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

The wait is over. And the time is now. Many said it would &lt;em&gt;never &lt;/em&gt;happen,&lt;br&gt;that Max and &lt;strong&gt;Iggor Cavalera&lt;/strong&gt;, the Brazilian brothers and visionaries that&lt;br&gt;formed the groundbreaking metal band Sepultura in 1983 would reunite to make&lt;br&gt;electrifying music together again. Despite having spent 12 years apart, the&lt;br&gt;inescapable fact remains: Max and Iggor share blood and are musical soulmates.&lt;br&gt;Their time away from each other fostered musical growth leading to the newly&lt;br&gt;inspired metallic magic. Hence, the Cavalera Conspiracy was born. While the&lt;br&gt;Cavalera Conspiracy and their &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt; debut &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflikted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;may seem like the closest we&apos;ll get to a Sepultura reunion, make no&lt;br&gt;mistake. The Cavalera Conspiracy is its own maniacal, untamable beast with its&lt;br&gt;own set of rules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Iggor sums up their musical connection,&lt;br&gt;simply stating, &quot;We don&apos;t need to speak. We look at each other and we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;With one look, we know if we&apos;re going in the right direction.&quot; That&apos;s how&lt;br&gt;clearly they understand one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Max continues, &quot;There was over 10 years of&lt;br&gt;not seeing or talking to each other at all, which is a long ass time. That&apos;s&lt;br&gt;what made it more special when it did finally happen. While we were working&lt;br&gt;together, I was thinking about how the last time I saw him, I was on a tour&lt;br&gt;bus, after my last show with Sepultura at the Brixton Academy. Fast forward and&lt;br&gt;I&apos;m picking him up at the airport in Phoenix. It was heavy and emotional.&lt;br&gt;Obviously, all those feelings, along with years of musical history, came&lt;br&gt;flooding back, and once the personal relationship was restored, the musical one&lt;br&gt;began to take shape. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The first seeds of the Max/Iggor reunion&lt;br&gt;were planted when the duo played together at the Dana Tribute show, an annual&lt;br&gt;benefit played for Max&apos;s slain stepson. &quot;I was playing with Iggor at a show&lt;br&gt;that was so meaningful,&quot; Max admits. &quot;We got to play &amp;lsquo;Roots&apos; and &amp;lsquo;Attitude,&apos;&lt;br&gt;which is a song I wrote with Dana.&amp;nbsp; From&lt;br&gt;that point on, I couldn&apos;t help myself. I knew I wanted to record with him&lt;br&gt;again. I had not done a &amp;lsquo;project&apos; since Nailbomb, which was a long time ago.&lt;br&gt;Iggor loved the idea. With no name, I just wrote songs all day long. We had to&lt;br&gt;find musicians, and set the mood so we could just write a kick ass record.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Iggor has similar fond memories of that show and that feeling, &quot;Once we hit the&lt;br&gt;first note, it felt like a bomb had dropped on stage. From that moment on, I&lt;br&gt;knew we needed to do something together musically.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Iggor continues,&lt;br&gt;&quot;We reunited as a family first. Naturally, music came next. At first, we had no&lt;br&gt;idea we would do music again. I have my own new project, and that takes so much&lt;br&gt;of my time. I had no plans at all of going back and doing a metal project. But&lt;br&gt;at the same time, it was natural to play again with Max.&quot; Max compares the&lt;br&gt;situation to &lt;em&gt;The Godfather Part III, &lt;/em&gt;exclaiming, &quot;Just when Al Pacino&lt;br&gt;thought he was out, his family pulled him right back into the shit again!&lt;br&gt;That&apos;s what I did: I pulled him right back.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The brothers&lt;br&gt;recruited Gojira guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Joe Duplantier&lt;/strong&gt; to play bass.&amp;nbsp; Guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Marc Rizzo&lt;/strong&gt;, who plays&lt;br&gt;guitar in Max&apos;s main band Soulfly, was enlisted to play guitar. The duo&lt;br&gt;purposely chose more up and coming musicians, because they didn&apos;t want to&lt;br&gt;detract from the music. &quot;We didn&apos;t want big names,&quot; Max says. &quot;It was about me&lt;br&gt;and Iggor finding ourselves. This is about the music. We found cool musicians&lt;br&gt;without pretension, who wanted to go into the studio and just kick ass.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Once recording commenced, Max brought a&lt;br&gt;bunch of songs he had written. Album opener &quot;Inflikted&quot; is an urgent, thrashy&lt;br&gt;anthem designed for the most riotous moshpits, while &quot;Sanctuary&quot; has a classic &lt;em&gt;Beneath&lt;br&gt;The Remains-&lt;/em&gt;era Sepultura vibe. Max says, &quot;I brought the tracks to the&lt;br&gt;studio without the fury. Iggor put his &amp;lsquo;thunder drums&apos; on top of it and it&lt;br&gt;became something else!&quot; Although Iggor exited Sepultura and is working on his&lt;br&gt;electronic music project, that familiar feeling coursed through his veins when&lt;br&gt;he sat down to track drums. &quot;We had no pressure on our backs. The most&lt;br&gt;important thing is that we were happy in the studio; we worked a lot and it was&lt;br&gt;a blast. That translates into the music,&quot; Iggor says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When describing the sonic assault that is &quot;Black Ark,&quot; Max states,&lt;br&gt;&quot;I think &quot;Black Ark&quot;&amp;nbsp;is the most different song on&lt;em&gt; Inflikted&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;My son Richie, was the first vocalist to sing on it and he set the pace for a&lt;br&gt;different vocal pattern that Joe and I picked up on.&amp;nbsp; It made the track&lt;br&gt;more unique than the other songs.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; About half way into the album, the brothers&lt;br&gt;Cavalera hit you over the head with the brutal &quot;Ultra-Violent&quot; which features &lt;strong&gt;Rex&lt;br&gt;Brown&lt;/strong&gt; of Down and Pantera on bass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I think I gave him a very exciting, different song to work on, more of&lt;br&gt;a death metal vibe.&amp;nbsp; We had a great time talking about our old metal&lt;br&gt;adventures,&quot; says Max.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the time the record was finished, Max&lt;br&gt;knew that they had recaptured the magic. &quot;My brother makes the drums sound like&lt;br&gt;thunder like no one else. Not many musicians can grab a kit and change the sound&lt;br&gt;and personality of the drums, but he can.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It&apos;s fucking scary.&quot; While the Soulfly and Sepultura comparisons will&lt;br&gt;undoubtedly - natch - arise, both brothers contend that the Cavalera Conspiracy&lt;br&gt;is different because their tastes and influences have grown over the years.&lt;br&gt;There&apos;s less of a world vibe on&lt;em&gt; Inflikted,&lt;/em&gt; but its every bit as&lt;br&gt;dangerous, thanks to its &quot;fuck the world&quot; attitude.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Why do I get goosebumps when listening to this? I don&apos;t want to&lt;br&gt;know,&quot; says Max. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; According to Iggor, &lt;em&gt;Inflikted&apos;s&lt;/em&gt; balance of the old and the new is what he loves about it and he thinks&lt;br&gt;metalheads across the globe will share the same notion. &quot;When I listen to the&lt;br&gt;album, it sounds old school, but new in its own way,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s a mix of&lt;br&gt;both worlds. We both listened to so much different music during the time apart.&lt;br&gt;Here, we each had our own input, so it came out different than back in the&lt;br&gt;day.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Summing up their personal chemistry, which&lt;br&gt;is palpable on the booming &quot;Bloodbrawl&quot; and the uber thrash attack &quot;Terrorize,&quot;&lt;br&gt;Max says, &quot;I&apos;m crazy. I used to drink. I talk. He is quiet. He has never drank&lt;br&gt;before. It&apos;s this weird combo that becomes lethal together. You either like it&lt;br&gt;or hate it, but you can&apos;t ignore it. We&apos;re like a bomb.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collective Soul&lt;/strong&gt; gained a special place in the hearts of music lovers when they burst onto the scene in 1993 with the rock anthem &amp;ldquo;Shine.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine that the band has been making music for nearly 2 decades since then.&amp;nbsp; Hard, that is, until you turn on the radio and find yourself singing along to &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Staring Down&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;rdquo; the new radio smash from the band&amp;rsquo;s upcoming self-titled album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;What inspires a multi-platinum band with a catalog of #1 hit singles to keep going? It&amp;rsquo;s quite simple:&amp;nbsp; the love of the music. While it would have been easy for the members of Collective Soul &amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Ed Roland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dean Roland&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Will Turpin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Joel Kosche&lt;/strong&gt; - to rest on their laurels, the excitement they feel for their forthcoming (and 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; self-titled) release is palpable. &amp;ldquo;Everybody just really took a big step, dug in, and worked together as a band. It was really nice,&amp;rdquo; says Ed Roland &amp;ldquo;It made everything smoother and that&amp;rsquo;s why I think it&amp;rsquo;s the best work we&amp;rsquo;ve done in years.&amp;rdquo; After years of touring together, with hit after successive hit, Collective Soul is as focused as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;2009 finds the band releasing their 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; studio album on a new label, Loud &amp;amp; Proud/Roadrunner Records. The album opens with &amp;ldquo;Welcome All Again,&amp;rdquo; a rousing number about life in the studio (Roland&amp;rsquo;s lake house), and is a sure bet to be the concert opener on the new tour. &amp;ldquo;The lake house was extremely important to us,&amp;rdquo; says Ed, &amp;ldquo;It enclosed us so we had to get up in the morning and work all day. It&amp;rsquo;s a home, so it gave us freedom with time and schedules. &amp;nbsp;Everyone can wake up, have their coffee, do their morning routine &amp;hellip;then when the vibe starts you let it go until the vibe ends. &amp;nbsp;I truly believe the lake house helped bring Collective Soul together, better than ever. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;With first single &amp;ldquo;Staring Down,&amp;rdquo; Collective Soul is convincing us that the world doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a dark place after a bad relationship, &amp;ldquo;You get out of a relationship and you realize you can let go of that energy; if you leave yourself open to positive energy, you find it&amp;rsquo;s right there in front of you. Just let it find you.&amp;rdquo; Says Roland. Other hot tracks include the driving &amp;ldquo;Dig,&amp;rdquo; the sobering, yet funky riffed &amp;ldquo;My Days,&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;You,&amp;rdquo; the first song Collective Soul has ever written as a unit, and &amp;ldquo;Fuzzy,&amp;rdquo; with the whole band harmonizing together as good as any Beach Boys single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The record ends with a quiet, spiritual reflection in &amp;ldquo;Hymn For My Father:&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;It&apos;s fitting,&amp;rdquo; says Ed, &amp;ldquo;I grew up singing hymns and with my father&apos;s passing 4 years ago it&apos;s truly a tribute to him. He taught me the music I grew up listening too which he loved and I really wanted to write a fitting tribute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hailing from the city of Atlanta, Georgia, Collective Soul shot to international fame with their 1993 release &lt;em&gt;Hints, Allegations and Things Left Unsaid&lt;/em&gt;, and their mega #1 hit &amp;ldquo;Shine.&amp;rdquo; The album was a collection of Ed Roland&amp;rsquo;s demos that spread quickly through the college underground circuit and caught fire, going on to achieve Double-Platinum status. After having been invited to the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary Woodstock concert, Collective Soul went into the studio to record their sophomore follow up. The self-titled &lt;em&gt;Collective Soul&lt;/em&gt;, released in March of 1995, would be the album that would help define their sound of catchy melodies and guitar driven songs. Containing four outstanding singles (three of which reached #1), &amp;ldquo;December,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The World I Know,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Where The River Flows,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gel,&amp;rdquo; it became Collective Soul&apos;s highest selling album to date. The album went Triple-Platinum and spent 76 weeks on the Billboard Top 200 charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Collective Soul went back into the studio and vented their spleen on 1997&amp;rsquo;s Platinum &lt;em&gt;Disciplined Breakdown&lt;/em&gt;, which produced two more #1 hits, &amp;ldquo;Precious Declaration&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Listen&lt;strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong&gt;1999 brought the album &lt;em&gt;Dosage&lt;/em&gt;, a critically acclaimed set of songs that fans count as the band&amp;rsquo;s best. The album took a meticulous six months to record, and provided another strong showing for the band, producing the #1 hit song &amp;ldquo;Heavy,&amp;rdquo; which would take the top &lt;em&gt;Billboard &lt;/em&gt;spot for a (then) record of 15 weeks.&amp;nbsp; Of the band&amp;rsquo;s 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; studio album, &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; cheered, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Blender&lt;/em&gt; simply shreds with unapologetic classic-rock energy.&amp;rdquo; Once again, the band teamed with Resta, and created three more radio heavy smash hits with &amp;ldquo;Why, Part 2,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Vent&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Perfect Day,&amp;rdquo; a duet with Sir Elton John.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;After releasing a Greatest Hits set entitled &lt;em&gt;7even Year Itch: Greatest Hits 1994-2001&lt;/em&gt;, Collective Soul ended their contract with Atlantic Records and created their own label El Music Group. The first release on the label was &lt;em&gt;Youth&lt;/em&gt; (2004). The lyrics, in particular &amp;ldquo;Better Now,&amp;rdquo; declared the band&apos;s newfound confidence and independence. Two other records and a concert DVD were released under the El Music Group imprint: 2005&amp;rsquo;s EP &lt;em&gt;From the Ground Up&lt;/em&gt; and 2006&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Home &lt;/em&gt;- their lush, live, concert event with the Atlanta City Youth Orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;In 2007 the band made an exclusive deal with all Target stores to be the sole seller of their 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Studio album, &lt;em&gt;Afterwords. &lt;/em&gt;The fans dug it, opening at #25 on the &lt;em&gt;Billboard &lt;/em&gt;Comprehensive Albums Chart and #5 on the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; Top Internet Albums Chart, proving Collective Soul was now conquering the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;Tremble For My Beloved&quot; found Collective Soul on the soundtrack to one of the hottest movies of 2008 &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;We heard through the grapevine that Stephanie Meyer was a fan of Collective Soul&apos;s music and lyrics,&amp;rdquo; says Ed. Expanding to tweens opened up a whole new audience for the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fast-forward to 2009 with new fans, a new label and new momentum. Collective Soul is excited by their latest studio effort and is back to having fun. And for all the &amp;ldquo;collective souls&amp;rdquo; who have followed the band from day one, Roland speaks from his heart: &amp;ldquo;Thank you for hanging in there with us and we hope you like the new album. We are all really proud of it.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Collective Soul &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be released on Loud &amp;amp; Proud/Roadrunner Records on August 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevilDriver &lt;/strong&gt;has always been a band on a three-pronged mission: Work hard, rock harder, and kick as many asses as possible in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since first forming in 2003, the Santa Barbara metal quintet has stuck resolutely to this mission, even though it&apos;s often meant traveling a rougher, less glamorous road than most musicians would prefer to endure. Rather than cashing in on the popularity of his previous successes, frontman &lt;strong&gt;Dez Fafara&lt;/strong&gt; insisted from the get-go that DevilDriver should not only forge their own unique sound, but should also start at the proverbial bottom of the bill and work their way up through endless touring, earning the music world&apos;s respect one fan at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I get that hard-working attitude from my father,&quot; says Dez. &quot;I believe in gnawing at the bit, you know? It&apos;s taken its toll on us, sure - but hard work, road work and belief in ourselves is what we&apos;re based on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pray For Villains&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, DevilDriver&apos;s gut-punching new album, is clearly the culmination of that endless hard work and unconquerable self-belief. Having honed their powerful sound over the course of three previous albums - 2003&apos;s self-titled debut, 2005&apos;s &lt;em&gt;The Fury of Our Maker&apos;s Hand&lt;/em&gt; and 2007&apos;s &lt;em&gt;The Last Kind Words&lt;/em&gt; -&amp;nbsp;and countless live dates (including their legendary Download appearance in 2007, where the band&apos;s ferocious performance triggered what many believe to be the largest circle pit in history), the band is now operating at a higher level than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;For us, it&apos;s been a constant growth, musically,&quot; Dez explains. &quot;Not only in terms of finding out how to write together, but in figuring out what a good DevilDriver song &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. Every single record has been a progression, and we approached everything the same way as we&apos;ve always done, but it clicked really hard on this record. This is the defining sound of what we are, and where we&apos;re going to go in the future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced by former Machine Head/Soulfly guitarist Logan Mader (who has previously manned the controls for the Cavalera Conspiracy, Divine Heresy and Five Finger Death Punch), &lt;em&gt;Pray For Villains&lt;/em&gt; finds DevilDriver rocking as brutally as ever, with the rhythm section of drummer John Boecklin and bassist Jon Miller pummeling the listener into submission while the guitar tag-team of Jeff Kendrick and Mike Spreitzer lets fly with one nasty riff and incendiary solo after another, and Dez truly howls like a man possessed. The album is both more technical and more straightforward than anything DevilDriver has done in the past, but there&apos;s also an additional emphasis on groove, dynamics and song-craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We decided not to go even more brutal, more heavy, more screamy, more fast than last time, because we&apos;ve already proved we can do that,&quot; says Dez. &quot;There&apos;s a lot more groove going on, a lot more dynamics. The guitar work is amazing -some of the solos absolutely blow me away - and the drumming is un-fucking-real. There&apos;s gonna be kids in their basements trying to learn this shit forever. Yet we also said, &amp;lsquo;Let&apos;s not only bring groove into this, but let&apos;s bring hooks, and let&apos;s write &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; songs.&apos; We didn&apos;t dial it down at all, but we wanted to add some substance to it, as well.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyrically and thematically, the album&apos;s rampaging title track pretty much sums up where Dez is coming from on &lt;em&gt;Pray For Villains&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Inspired by his love of Western films, the song is about &quot;how you put all your eggs in one basket, and you bet on the hero - but it&apos;s actually the bad-ass villain who comes in and saves the day,&quot; he explains. &quot;I love Westerns, especially the ones with Clint Eastwood; I like the anti-heroes, rather than the John Wayne kind of guys. I was thinking that in those films, just like in real life, it usually takes a fucking bad-ass to come in and do the job - and that&apos;s usually not the guy in white with the shiny gun. A lot of these songs, including &amp;lsquo;Resurrection Blvd.,&apos; &amp;lsquo;In The Cards&apos; and &amp;lsquo;Forgiveness Is A Six-Gun,&apos; are definitely influenced by that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Themes of self-reliance, hard work and positive energy also run through tracks like &quot;I See Belief,&quot; &quot;Pure Sincerity&quot; and &quot;Back With A Vengeance,&quot; all of which reflect both the scars and the hard-won accomplishments of DevilDriver&apos;s first half-decade. &quot;I&apos;m not a nihilistic dude,&quot; Dez explains. &quot;The line,&amp;lsquo;I see belief when no one else does&apos; - a lot of people are so negative about things, saying, &amp;lsquo;Oh, that will never work,&apos; or &apos;We&apos;ll never get that tour,&apos; or &amp;lsquo;We&apos;ll never get to that place&apos; but I&apos;m just not that guy. Call it stupidity or blind luck,&quot; he laughs, &quot;but I&apos;ve got a feel for what&apos;s going to happen with this band. I believe in the motivation and upward mobility of this band, as well as the movement and the bond that we&apos;re creating between our fans and us. I want to bring that positivity through the power of metal and say to people, &amp;lsquo;Hey, keep your head up/Get your head out of the sand&apos;- take a breath of fresh air, try to be positive about life, and move through it with strength, power and belief in yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of &quot;Pure Sincerity,&quot; Dez reveals, &quot;That&apos;s for when people ask, &amp;lsquo;What&apos;s DevilDriver about?&apos; Well, listen to &amp;lsquo;Pure Sincerity&apos;: &amp;lsquo;Give &amp;lsquo;em what they want/Give &amp;lsquo;em what they need/Pure Sincerity&apos;. That&apos;s all it&apos;s ever been, from the time we started making music - giving them what we feel is &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; music, and not trying to follow any kind of trend.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Back With a Vengeance&quot; is a howl of triumph, a musical victory lap for a band that many critics discounted or disregarded, at least until DevilDriver&apos;s ever-increasing fanbase and reputation for consistently punishing live shows became simply too much to ignore. &quot;That song&apos;s about looking yourself in the mirror and going, &amp;lsquo;Yep, that&apos;s right, we&apos;re kicking ass like I always knew we would be,&apos;&quot; Dez explains. &quot;Don&apos;t ever count any motherfucker out in life. It may have taken a record or three to get it through everybody&apos;s heads, but now it&apos;s obvious. And on &amp;lsquo;Back With A Vengeance,&apos; I&apos;m actually giving myself a minute to step back and look at DevilDriver and go, &amp;lsquo;Holy shit, we all built this thing together - and it&apos;s a monstrous machine!&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To no one&apos;s surprise, DevilDriver will be taking that monstrous machine on the road for the rest of 2009, and probably beyond. (The band&apos;s innate affinity for touring is reflected on the new tracks &quot;I&apos;ve Been Sober&quot; and &quot;Another Night In London.&quot;) &quot;We need to travel,&quot; says Dez. &quot;So we&apos;re booked through Christmas &amp;lsquo;09; we&apos;re going all over the world, and we&apos;re not coming home. Our schedule is so rigorous, it&apos;s unreal - sometimes even I don&apos;t know why I put myself through it - but I love the road. I love my family, but I can&apos;t sit home for more than two weeks,&quot; he laughs. &quot;I think time for me at home is wasted right now. I&apos;m still young enough to go out and do my thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have to love what you do,&quot; Dez concludes. &quot;We love to play together as a band, we love to be onstage, and we love to deliver our music to people live. We&apos;ve always said that&apos;s been part of the mission - and if you&apos;re gonna talk it, you&apos;ve gotta walk it.&quot;&amp;lt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

Dommin are inviting everyone to join them in the dark introspection that goes hand in hand with heartbreak. On their Roadrunner Records debut, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love Is Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, due out in spring 2009, Dommin delves into complex relationships, damaged psyches and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the center of their haunting, gothic-tinged rock is the enigmatic &lt;strong&gt;Kristofer Dommin&lt;/strong&gt;, who croons about poisonous love, exorcising agony through a wall of distortion and a jagged sonic sieve. Kristofer, also the band&apos;s guitarist and principal songwriter, sums up the band&apos;s message best, &quot;It&apos;s about finding love, losing love and personal reflection - universal themes that transcend genre distinctions. The emotional element is more defining than how much keyboards, guitars or drums we have in a song.&quot; It is also Kristofer&apos;s unique and compelling voice that drives the power and passion of every word he sings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Bassist &lt;strong&gt;Billy James&lt;/strong&gt; offers a direct take on the band&apos;s uniquely layered sound, saying &quot;It&apos;s alternative, dark, romantic rock that has a lot of heavy guitars, keyboards and passion behind the lyrics and music. Kris is a very intense person and his lyrics reflect a lot of his personality. He&apos;s using his experiences, his voice and our influences to make something really special.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kristofer continues, &quot;The majority of the music concerns love and relationships. These things have been around as long as people have. We all roughly feel the same things and go through the same things. We all go through tough times. We all recover. We all move on. And then we all go through these things again. That cycle is a large part of the human condition. We learn about ourselves in the process and about others. We&apos;re not all that different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;It&apos;s whatever really moves me,&quot; Kristofer says about his lyrical approach. &quot;A song for me is never complete until I&apos;m able look back and make sense of things. So, in some ways, I feel like a storyteller. Everyone responds to life&apos;s challenges differently. Some people go out and run a mile. Some people paint. I write music.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The origins of Dommin can be traced back to 2000, when Kristofer formed the band in San Dimas, just outside of Los Angeles. He added Billy James to the fold as keyboardist two years later and the band&apos;s line-up began to take shape as James eventually switched to bass when the pair found &lt;strong&gt;Konstantine&lt;/strong&gt; in 2006. Dommin&apos;s vision was becoming fully realized. By this time, Kristofer had already written many of the songs that would comprise &lt;em&gt;Love Is Gone&lt;/em&gt;. The last ingredient in Dommin&apos;s sonic stew came in the form of drummer &lt;strong&gt;Cameron Morris&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Dommin&apos;s&amp;nbsp;songs are like individual epics, each&amp;nbsp;showing off the band&apos;s broad range of emotional depth and ability to cycle through several moods, tempos and musical styles with considerable deftness. In&amp;nbsp;the soaring opener and one of the album&apos;s many highlights &quot;My Heart, Your Hands,&quot;&amp;nbsp;the song&apos;s epic keyboard embrace gives way to raw, powerful riffs which slash away at the listener and serve as the bed to an unforgettable chorus and a somber message. &quot;I Still Lost&quot; traverses even darker territory. Kristofer opens up about the song&apos;s subject matter, saying &quot;It&apos;s a very defeated and humble song about feeling like no matter what I did, no matter how hard I tried, it just wasn&apos;t going to work the way I wanted. Regardless of all my efforts, I lost. So that&apos;s what I said to myself, I still lost. I tried this. I still lost. I did that. I still lost. It was a statement that defined that moment in my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;Tonight&quot; bleeds with sprawling, melodic touches and is driven by Kristofer&apos;s intimate vocals. The intricate web and sonic soundscape Dommin designs on its songs is quite evident in the twisted Doors-like &quot;Dark Holiday&quot; while &quot;&apos;Without End&quot; is a &quot;romantic song, but it&apos;s about a very unhealthy, obsessive love.&quot; Kristofer cites the title track &quot;Love is Gone&quot; as his favorite song on the record, since &quot;it defines the basis of all the songs on the album. It&apos;s a very tortured, painful album in the sense that even the songs that seem like a positive spin on love, at its source, involve a very noxious kind of love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Kristofer finds influence and&amp;nbsp;inspiration outside of the norm and in an unexpected places - from crooners of the &amp;lsquo;40s and &amp;lsquo;50s to film scores. &quot;I&apos;m into everything from the &lt;em&gt;Cinderella Man&lt;/em&gt; score to &lt;em&gt;The Transformers&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack. Anything that sounds really moving and epic appeals to me. People fail to recognize how much the music in a movie is affecting their mood and experience. I&apos;ve always paid&amp;nbsp; close attention to it and having the keyboards in Dommin is virtually like having an orchestra at our fingertips.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ultimately, Dommin&apos;s music is truly for everybody. Given the relatable lyrics, it&apos;s easy to see why disaffected youth, the lovelorn or even the average Jane or Joe will be magnetically attracted to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Love Is Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Dommin speaks on a topic that affects us all and the music acts as a unifying force for those who flock to music when life knocks them down. &quot;We make music for anyone who is feeling what the average person feels in a day,&quot; concludes Kristofer. &quot;The words and music are there for those misunderstood people who need to know that there is someone out there who feels the same.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Welcome to the end of love and the beginning of Dommin.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

They&apos;ve grown from relative unknowns in the United States to an impossible-to-ignore phenomenom that&apos;s spread across message boards and schoolyards, thanks to their tuneful, epic and guitar-driven anthems, their high-level inclusion on Guitar Hero 3:Legends of Rock and a near-constant touring schedule. The single &quot;Through the Fire and Flames&quot; has been RIAA-certified Gold and 2006&apos;s Inhuman Rampage, which debuted at #1 on Billboard&apos;s Heatseeker&apos;s Chart, has sold over 300,000 copies in its wake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over those two fateful years following the album&apos;s release, the band toured America for the first time in their career and were embraced with open arms. The first tour was sold out before Inhuman Rampage even hit record store shelves and the marathon cycle continued for well over a year, as they dominated the main stage of 2006&apos;s Ozzfest, followed that up with a sold-out headline run and a plum support slot opening for new labelmates, Killswitch Engage, before heading home to work on Ultra Beatdown, an excellent effort that rivals its predecessor in every facet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultra Beatdown is bigger, louder and faster, teeming with guitar solos that are sure to wear the fingerprints off the hands of Herman Li and Sam Totman, the band&apos;s virtuoso tandem of shredders. Vocalist ZP Theart gives the performance of his career, reaching for the stars with his soaring, powerful voice, while bassist Frederic Leclercq and drummer Dave Mackintosh provide the sturdy rhythmic backbone for the album. Keytarist Vadim Pruzhanov layers the band&apos;s sound with a healthy dose of keys and the end result is an album that thrills with glorious guitars, siren-like vocals and memorable melodic flair. If DragonForce arrived on American shores with Inhuman Rampage, they are poised to conquer with Ultra Beatdown, set for release on August 26.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DragonForce are much more than a band; they&apos;re almost like a cult that has commanded a legion of diehard fans that range from guitar nerds, video game aficionados and young, impressionable kids who are just discovering music as they attempt to jam out to Dragonforce while playing Guitar Hero. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We are not deluded, thinking we are rock stars or cool or taking over the world or are the future of metal,&quot; says Li, with his trademark dry-and possibly humble-British wit. &quot;We approached this album the same way we always have. We treat it like we haven&apos;t got any fans, since we are trying to make music we want to hear ourselves. We have been listening to metal for so long that we are sick and tired of hearing the same thing all the time. We want to make the catchiest album ever and we want to do something that you can&apos;t hear from other bands that play the same style that we do.&quot; Clearly, DragonForce are their own biggest critics; they set the bar high for themselves as musicians. Li continues, &quot;We&apos;re not going to change our music for the world, but we&apos;re going to improve so we can take what we do and make it better.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That type of passion for music is what drives DragonForce in the middle of all the Guitar Hero hype. The band remains grounded and is staying the course, infusing Ultra Beatdown with the same bombastic guitarwork and battlecry lyrics. Li is adamant that the band isn&apos;t going to cater to anyone but themselves and their truest fans, saying,&amp;nbsp; &quot;People were already listening to us before anyone found Inhuman Rampage. Our first US tour sold out before the album came out. People liked us before Guitar Hero. Our goal is to take all the experience we&apos;ve accumulated and make our live show ever better.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self-produced Ultra Beatdown keeps the patented DragonForce pace and burns itself into the fabric of your brain with its massive melodies and air-guitarable solos. Li sheds a little light on the songwriting process, saying &quot;When you write a song, you never know how it is going to turn out. We approach it so that we have to do the best song possible without overlooking the production, since we produce it ourselves.&amp;nbsp; We don&apos;t want three-minute songs you can swallow and enjoy. We like fast, seven minute songs where there is so much stuff happening. The idea is not to compromise. We can&apos;t deliver our message in the space of three minutes and we&apos;re not looking to write hits. All we want to do is write what is a great piece of music, a combination of metal and rock.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DragonForce aren&apos;t masking their motives, and they back up their confidence with both skill and talent that separates them from anyone who can be considered their peers. Li says, &quot;The speed is so obvious, so that is the first thing.&amp;nbsp; So many bands play fast, even faster than us, but it&apos;s not melodic. Ultra Beatdown has the whole package of melody, arrangement and catchiness with the speed.&quot; The band also claims video game music as an influence, simply because it&apos;s melodic and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to this patented style, Ultra Beatdown pulses with anthemic, feel good, battle-ready and uplifting songs. Li laughs when pointing out &quot;the funny thing is that we just want to create a catchy, memorable tune and when we do that, even the sadder songs sound happy! Our songs are tuneful but they also touch your heart.&quot;&amp;nbsp; Indeed, &quot;Heroes of Our Time,&quot; the album&apos;s first single, is catchy and room filling, while &quot;Last Journey Home&quot; shows a different, slower side of the band, illustrating their range and musicianship, which is something each member takes very seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the band is known for fun live shows that often saw them jumping on trampolines and mimicking each other while performing, they are as serious as a terminal disease about their craft. &quot;Our personalities are so different,&quot; Li explains. &quot;But we got together to make an album and the whole thing comes together and is special. We have a serious side in making music, but when we are tour and people see and hear us enjoying ourselves. We&apos;re serious about our playing and we&apos;re happy with being cool and nerdy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another element that makes DragonForce so special is the fact that each member hails from a different country and background. Li is from Hong Kong, while Theart was born in South Africa. Totman is a New Zealander, while Leclerqc is French, Prushanov is Romanian and Mackintosh is British. This eclectic mix and disparate upbringings contribute to the melting pot that is the band.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Many bands come from same town, same school and are very similar,&quot; Li says. &quot;With us, absolutely not. Despite the different cultures and backgrounds,&amp;nbsp; we have a common goal in the end and that is to make a great album and enjoy ourselves at the same time in life, by doing music. It&apos;s down to that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, according to Li, DragonForce is &quot;a non-stop melody fest. It&apos;s never just riffs. If there is a riff, there is a melody on top.&quot; They&apos;ve incorporated the influence of guitar titans like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as well as video games, thus creating a style uniquely their own that is appealing to music nerds, the general public or anyone who likes intensity in their music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Li finishes, summing up the band&apos;s recent trajectory, saying, &quot;Ultra Beatdown follows the path of our last two albums. Sonic Firestorm implies that the sound is going to blow you away, whereas Inhuman Rampage indicates that we&apos;re going to musically kick your ass. Ultra Beatdown is where the music is kicking your ass and giving you the biggest beatdown possible. The music is going to kick your ass.&quot; Armed with a boatload of melody and intensity, this is one Beatdown you will more than enjoy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s knack for balancing the epic and the intimate has been a constant throughout the band&amp;rsquo;s lengthy evolution.&amp;nbsp; The group first came together in 1985, when Petrucci, Portnoy and bassist John Myung were students at Boston&amp;rsquo;s Berklee School of Music.&amp;nbsp; Initially known as Majesty, the nascent combo quickly gained a reputation in the grassroots metal underground, with their cassette &lt;em&gt;The Majesty Demos&lt;/em&gt; becoming a sought-after item in the metal community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream Theater made a mainstream splash with their 1992 sophomore album &lt;em&gt;Images And Words&lt;/em&gt;, which spawned the MTV-fueled hit &amp;ldquo;Pull Me Under.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; The band then began a long association with Atlantic/East West, achieving substantial success with the albums &lt;em&gt;Images and Words&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Awake&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Falling into Infinity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Train of Thought&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Octavarium&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The group&apos;s skill and versatility expanded with the crucial additions of lead vocalist James LaBrie in 1991 and keyboardist Jordan Rudess in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s individualistic approach often put the band at odds with the methods of the major-label world.&amp;nbsp; But their dynamic recorded output and exciting, surprise-filled live shows nonetheless earned the group a large and uncommonly loyal worldwide audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being on a major label never really felt like the right place for us, but they kept renewing our contract because our fan base was strong enough to justify it,&amp;rdquo; Portnoy says.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;They tried to get us onto the radio, and tried to promote us through all of the traditional means, but we always felt like a round peg in a square hole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 2007&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Systematic Chaos&lt;/em&gt;, Dream Theater moved to the more hospitable environment of Roadrunner Records.&amp;nbsp; The move yielded immediate results, with &lt;em&gt;Systematic Chaos&lt;/em&gt; becoming the band&amp;rsquo;s highest-charting album to date.&amp;nbsp; The album&amp;rsquo;s release coincided with the publication of &lt;em&gt;Lifting Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, an authorized biography recounting Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s first twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Once we came to Roadrunner, it really felt like home,&amp;rdquo; Portnoy states.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I think they understand how to deal with a band like us, and they trust us to give us the space to do what we do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream Theater may well be the ultimate cult band, receiving relatively little mainstream exposure yet continuing to make music on their own terms while maintaining a large international fan following, whose devotion is anything but casual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re probably the only band that can fill Radio City Music Hall in New York or Wembley Arena in London or the Budokan in Tokyo and still not be a household name,&amp;rdquo; Portnoy notes.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;But in some ways, that&amp;rsquo;s worked in our favor, because we&amp;rsquo;ve never had to worry about being overexposed or being a flash in the pan.&amp;nbsp; Dream Theater fans are amongst the most hardcore, lifelong fans you&amp;rsquo;ll ever see.&amp;nbsp; We have fans who follow us around on tour and rework their lives around our tour schedule, and now they&amp;rsquo;re bringing their kids to the shows.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It definitely takes a certain attention span to be a Dream Theater fan,&amp;rdquo; Petrucci points out.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;The fact that we use unusual arrangements and longer song lengths to develop ideas and tell a story can scare people off, because it&amp;rsquo;s not party music that you can just put on in the background.&amp;nbsp; But the people who get it are passionate about it.&amp;nbsp; I think they appreciate that we never phone it in, and they know that they can expect something interesting from us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being a Dream Theater fan is a commitment, but I think that you get out of it what you put into it,&amp;rdquo; adds Portnoy, who oversees the archival official-bootleg and fan-club releases that the band regularly makes available to fans through the band&amp;rsquo;s YtseJam label.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Not everybody is willing to take the journey, but I think that if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to invest the time, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be that much more fulfilling.&amp;nbsp; And the reward for us is having these fans that have really stuck by us and helped to sustain us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s restless creativity extends to their high-energy live shows, which have become more ambitious and diverse, as the band&amp;rsquo;s career has progressed.&amp;nbsp; One distinctive aspect of Dream Theater&amp;rsquo;s concerts is their ever-changing set list, which Portnoy oversees to ensure that no two shows are alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band&amp;rsquo;s fans have also enthusiastically supported a variety of adventurous side projects featuring Dream Theater members, including Liquid Tension Experiment, Explorers Club, MullMuzzler, OSI, Platypus, The Jelly Jam, Transatlantic and True Symphonic Rockestra.&amp;nbsp; But it&apos;s Dream Theater that commands the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of the five musicians&amp;rsquo; attentions, and their longstanding creative rapport has never been more riveting than on &lt;em&gt;Black Clouds &amp;amp; Silver Linings&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&apos;re in an amazing situation now, where we have complete creative freedom,&amp;rdquo; Portnoy concludes.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;We can make any kind of record we want, and know that fans and our label will support it.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;re basically making records for ourselves and our fans, and not having to worry about what anyone else thinks.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s taken 24 years to earn that, but now that we have, it&amp;rsquo;s a great place to be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

Both were sick of genre classifications,determined to create music that would pave its own ferocious, exciting path as a result of their own diverse, intriguing influences. Upon meeting, they both knew were made for each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -The band released one album on their own in 2003, a self-titled release, which was eventually picked up and re-released by Roadrunner Records. The band signed with Roadrunner in 2004, and subsequently put out a live DVD of a hometown show in 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Around that time, the band was hand-picked by Trent Reznor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to open for Nine Inch Nails, an event that would prove serendipitous as time went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -The Dresden Dolls released their sophomore album&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes Virginia&lt;/em&gt;, in 2006. Produced by Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie (Radiohead, The Pixies, Hole) and recorded over several weeks at Allaire Studios (a converted turn-of-the-century mansion in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York)&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, Virginia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was a rich tapestry that showcased the bands road-sharpened musical chemistry and their ability to rip open uncharted emotional seams; no topic was ever seen as taboo. It immediately won the attention of most of music&apos;s critical establishment, in addition to stealing the hearts of music fans the world over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -After &lt;em&gt;Yes, Virginia&apos;s&lt;/em&gt; release, the band toured extensively. They opened for Panic! at the Disco, and were invited by Cyndi Lauper to play on the True Colors Tour alongside The Gossip and Blondie&apos;s Deborah Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Never ones to confine their artistic vision to just their own band, Amanda and Brian created their own original musical which was performed for forty nights at the American Repertory Theatre, and won major critical acclaim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -The Dresden Dolls recently announced their newest endeavor, a new-school merchandising enterprise entitled Post-War Trade. A hands-on collaboration between the band and their fans, Post-War Trade makes limited edition artwork and merchandise created by the fans themselves available to other fans of the Dolls. As a band who has always opened up their visual art endeavors to their fanbase, Post-War Trade is the ultimate expression of gratitude from the Dolls to their supporters, allowing them to interact with the band like never before and create something that resonates within their own community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -The Dolls newest album, &lt;em&gt;No,&lt;br&gt;Virginia&lt;/em&gt;, a companion album to &lt;em&gt;Yes, Virginia&lt;/em&gt; in some ways (and very much its own album in other ways), will be released in spring of 2008 on Roadrunner Records. Featuring songs from farwithin The Dresden Dolls catalog, in addition to never-recorded-before live favorites and more, &lt;em&gt;No, Virginia&lt;/em&gt; is a startling collection from two very brilliant, unique artists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Brian recently contributed drums to two songs on the newest Nine Inch Nails album, &lt;em&gt;Ghosts I-IV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Amanda will be playing her first solo shows with the legendary&lt;br&gt;Boston Pops in June 2008. She recently underwent surgery to remove vocal nodes, so it&apos;s likely these shows will feature some of her best vocal performances yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; -Amanda will release a solo album this coming fall.  Entitled &lt;em&gt;Who Killed Amanda Palmer?,&lt;/em&gt; the album is just as exciting, dynamic and exceptional as you would expect from our piano-pounding heroine.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

This new  song captures a certain energy we&apos;ve been trying to harness on record as well,  as it will show all our fans worldwide where Trivium is heading musically in the  future.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by Sony Computer Entertainment&amp;rsquo;s Santa Monica Studios, the &lt;em&gt;God  of War&lt;/em&gt; video game brings epic battles to life with stunning graphics and an  elaborate plot that puts Kratos at the center of carnage and destruction as he  seeks revenge against the Gods who have betrayed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is a registered trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment  America Inc. &amp;copy; Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc.&amp;nbsp; &quot;PlayStation&quot;,  &quot;PLAYSTATION&quot; and &quot;PS&quot; Family logo are registered trademarks of Sony Computer  Entertainment Inc.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

Crouch played most of the instruments on the album, but needed to put a group together to perform live.&amp;nbsp; He first turned to his childhood friend Chad Taylor to play bass.&amp;nbsp; Guitarist Joseph Stamp made a musical connection with Crouch during a chance meeting at a local club.&amp;nbsp; He had been working behind the scenes in a recording studio, and was dying to strap on his guitar again.&amp;nbsp; Joseph reached out to his friend Drew Dockrill to play drums and the journey began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We were very much a hired support band,&amp;rdquo; says Chad. &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wmm.warnermusic.ca/hailthevillain/video/?vID=63938696001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;But soon enough we started writing together.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Joe made it clear from the start that he&amp;rsquo;s a writer and that he&amp;rsquo;s not going to be pushed to the side&amp;rdquo;, recalls Crouch.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;And I made it clear that if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a better song, bring it to the table.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s been that way ever since in the band &amp;ndash; best idea always wins.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;One day while jamming, Joe played a new ri<char code="#1f"/>ff on his guitar. The rest of the band fell in step and that ri<char code="#1f"/>ff became &amp;ldquo;My Reward&amp;rdquo;. That moment of epiphany helped&lt;br /&gt;the band <char code="#1e"/>find its path. &amp;ldquo;I always found that the &amp;ldquo;My Reward&amp;rdquo; sound was the direction we really liked,&amp;rdquo; explains &lt;a href=&quot;/administration/artists/&amp;ldquo;Its got the march, its got the stomp, its got the four on the <char code="#1f"/>oor &amp;ndash; all the things we love about hard rock.&amp;rdquo;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Its got the march, its got the stomp, its got the four on the <char code="#1f"/>floor &amp;ndash; all the things we love about hard rock.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of years the Villains continued to work on their songs, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until they met producer Darryl Romphf and Engineer Alex &amp;ldquo;Condor&amp;rdquo; Aligizakis that they felt confident that their sound and energy could be captured on record.&amp;nbsp; After flying in from Vancouver for pre-production, Darryl, Condor, and the band moved to a farm in Dashwood, Ontario where they set up a hi-tech studio in a barn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the music had gotten heavier and edgier, Crouch&amp;rsquo;s lyrics also became darker and far more personal.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmm.warnermusic.ca/hailthevillain/video/?vID=63938687001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I was writing, I was under a lot of stress and was paranoid,&amp;rdquo; &lt;/a&gt;says the singer.&amp;nbsp; I thought my health was not right, I thought I was in trouble.&amp;nbsp; I made so many crazy mistakes instead of choosing the right path like my brother did.&amp;nbsp; We all dropped out of school&amp;hellip; I was just freaking out.&amp;nbsp; This record was the be all and end all.&amp;nbsp; If this didn&amp;rsquo;t work, I&amp;rsquo;d have to find a job and smarten up.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darryl pushed Bryan to embrace these feelings and express them in his lyrics.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;For the first time in my life I actually said it.&amp;nbsp; Everything from &amp;lsquo;Swan Dive&amp;rsquo;, which I will never talk about because it&amp;rsquo;s so incredibly personal, to &amp;lsquo;Take Back The Fear&amp;rsquo;, which was when I was coming out of my paranoia saying that I&amp;rsquo;m not going to be scared anymore.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m going to find out what&amp;rsquo;s wrong.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While designing the artwork, the band discovered that they had given birth to far more than the twelve songs on the record.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://wmm.warnermusic.ca/hailthevillain/video/?vID=63938877001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Normally I would do the graphic design for the band&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; says Taylor.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I tried different concepts but they all looked pretty generic.&amp;nbsp; Joe came up with the idea of doing the CD artwork like a comic book, and it grew from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration for the album&amp;rsquo;s songs, the band created a tale of hate, lust and deceit.&amp;nbsp; They gave the characters life and then set out to give them form.&amp;nbsp; Enter Rune Entertainment, an animation production house.&amp;nbsp; With the band, they created the shocking animated video for the first single &amp;ldquo;Take Back The Fear&amp;rdquo;, a Hail The Villain comic book, and a groundbreaking interactive website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2009, Hail The Villain inked a record deal with Warner Music Canada, and by the summer Roadrunner Records had come on board to release the album in the United States.&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Population: Declining&lt;/em&gt; will be released in the summer of 2010 along with the rest of the Hail The Villain universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wmm.warnermusic.ca/hailthevillain/video/?vID=63944940001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think the audience wants artists that are more than just a band that they&amp;rsquo;re going to forget about six months after their first hit single,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; says Crouch, always insisting on the last word.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;It even keeps me excited because I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what we&amp;rsquo;re going to do next.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s going to be some stupid conversation with some stupid idea, and then &amp;lsquo;BOOM&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenny Wayne Shepherd&lt;/strong&gt; started teaching himself guitar at an age when most kids are still focused on recess and lunch boxes. And he was just thirteen when New Orleans bluesman Bryan Lee brought him onstage to showcase his innate talent and already precision honed chops. Four Grammy nominations, two Billboard Music Awards and millions of albums later, life came full circle when Shepherd and his band assembled several generations worth of blues legends, including Lee, at the House Of Blues in Chicago, captured for posterity on the brand new &lt;em&gt;Live In Chicago&lt;/em&gt; album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Shepherd released his first in a string of platinum albums while still in high school, but the Shreveport, Louisiana born guitarist / singer / songwriter has never forgotten his roots nor his influences.&amp;nbsp;Placed behind only B.B. King and Eric Clapton in a &lt;em&gt;Guitar World&lt;/em&gt; list of blues guitarists, and a guy who also specializes in rock, Shepherd has graciously utilized his own stature, acting as a gateway for younger fans, to shine a spotlight on the great bluesmen of the past&amp;mdash;most notably on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Live In Chicago&lt;/em&gt;, the penultimate culmination of a multi-faceted, unprecedented project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The landmark concert was part of a nationwide tour Shepherd put together in support of the award-winning &lt;em&gt;10 Days Out: Blues from the Backroads&lt;/em&gt; project. The DVD / CD documentary shows Shepherd, whose own &lt;em&gt;Trouble Is...&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;album boasts the longest run in Billboard Blues Chart history (hitting the 2 year mark),&amp;nbsp;traveling around the country on a ten day trek interviewing and jamming with icons from the blues scene, including the surviving members of Muddy Waters and Howlin&apos; Wolf&apos;s bands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;We played with these guys on their front porches, in their backyards, stuff like that,&quot; Shepherd, now 33, explains.&amp;nbsp;Directed by Noble Jones, &lt;em&gt;10 Days Out&lt;/em&gt; was nominated for two Grammy Awards. Kenny soon devised the idea of taking some of these guys on the road with his band - vocalist Noah Hunt, drummer Chris Layton, bassist Scott Nelson and keyboardist Riley Osbourn. They toured for two months, joined by&amp;nbsp;Hubert Sumlin, Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith, Buddy Flett and Bryan Lee.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;We had such a great time that I decided we should capture some of it,&quot; Kenny says. &quot;I first intended on recording this just for my own private, personal benefit - just to have it for myself. It was just a real special experience for me. We recorded a couple of nights of the tour.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tommy Shannon, who with Layton formed the rhythm section in the late / great Stevie Ray Vaughan&apos;s band,&amp;nbsp;flew in for the Chicago gig, which cemented the evening as one for the record books.&amp;nbsp;Kenny was extremely sick that night and worried that he may not even be able to perform. Thankfully, adrenaline took over as he stepped onstage. A breathtaking performance followed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Live in Chicago&lt;/em&gt; features well-known staples from the Kenny Wayne Shepherd catalog alongside a batch of classic material chosen specially for these onstage collaborations. &quot;The music we played with these special guests actually isn&apos;t even the music from the &lt;em&gt;10 Days Out&lt;/em&gt; project,&quot; Kenny says. &quot;It&apos;s a good balance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The respective&amp;nbsp;r&amp;eacute;sum&amp;eacute;s of the guests on &lt;em&gt;Live in Chicago &lt;/em&gt;read like a history book of blues and rock n&apos; roll. Hubert Sumlin joined Howlin&apos; Wolf&apos;s band in 1949 at the age of eighteen. Hailed as one of the greatest guitarists of all time by &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;, he&apos;s beloved by everyone from Jimmy Page to Carlos Santana. &quot;He&apos;s influenced people like Clapton and Keith Richards,&quot; Kenny says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith, like Sumlin, played with Muddy Waters. He co-founded the Legendary Blues Band with Pinetop Perkins, Louis Meyers, Calvin Jones and Jerry Portnoy, racking up six Grammy Awards and memorably playing John Lee Hooker&apos;s backup band in &quot;The Blues Brothers.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&quot;We also had two people I looked up to tremendously growing up and learning to play guitar,&quot; Kenny says. &quot;Buddy Flett is from my hometown. He&apos;s one of the hottest guitar players from my area.&quot; And of course Bryan Lee, who gave Kenny Wayne Shepherd that big break early on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;With Kenny&apos;s strongest tunes from his best loved albums, his scorching band, that pedigree of guests and one of the most noteworthy performances in any genre in recent memory, &lt;em&gt;Live in Chicago&lt;/em&gt; is truly something special.&amp;nbsp;&quot;Usually a live record is just live versions of all of your old stuff,&quot; Shepherd rightly points out. &quot;This collection is a great, diverse combination for the fans.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

For their fifth album, &lt;em&gt;Killswitch Engage, &lt;/em&gt;Massachusetts pioneers Killswitch Engage took calculated risks and traversed a different route, going outside their comfort zones. The choice yielded impressive, incredible results. None of the changes, however, make the mighty KsE sound like anyone else but KsE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s different structures, but it&apos;s &lt;em&gt;still &lt;/em&gt;Killswitch. I tried different topics and delivery, but it&apos;s &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; Killswitch.&quot; says vocalist Howard Jones, summing up where KsE is in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;After bursting onto the scene in 2002 with the genre-defining &lt;em&gt;Alive or Just Breathing, &lt;/em&gt;notching a Grammy nomination in 2005 for the title track from 2004&apos;s Gold-certified &lt;em&gt;The End of Heartache &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;following up that landmark album with the near-Gold &lt;em&gt;As Daylight Dies &lt;/em&gt;and an appearance on &lt;em&gt;Jimmy Kimmel Live, &lt;/em&gt;KsE adopted a versatile, non-stop touring schedule. The band&apos;s road history includes two treks on Ozzfest, stints on Warped Tour and Taste of Chaos and having the rare ability to straddle the line between the metal and alternative scenes by touring with Slayer and Mastodon as easily as My Chemical Romance and Underoath. However, KsE elected not to coast on the wave of prior successes, which saw them become one of the premier, most successful bands to emerge from the so-called New Wave of American metal. The band opted to work with an outside producer for the first time in their career. Brendan O&apos;Brien (AC/DC, Rage Against the Machine, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots) was dispatched with the task, which saw the band record in locales other than their native Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We take so much care with the music,&quot; says bassist Mike D&apos;Antonio. &quot;We thought, &apos;Let&apos;s take things up a notch.&apos; Brendan liked the band and it made sense to collaborate with him.&quot; Jones also states, in his trademark self-deprecating humor, &quot;We&apos;re an easily identifiable band by our guitar tone, drums, and for better or worse, my voice.&quot; Jones challenged himself to explore a broader range of topics and to use his voice in other ways. &quot;You&apos;ll hear some things vocally that I&apos;ve never done,&quot; the singer says.&amp;nbsp; Jones also comments, &quot;You can count on anthems and positive lyrics, but hey, there&apos;s times when the sun isn&apos;t shining so brightly and some songs reflect that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guitarist and KsE class clown Adam Dutkiewicz, known for his crazy, hilarious stage antics, who co-produced &lt;em&gt;Killswitch Engage, &lt;/em&gt;concurs, saying, &quot;We wanted to redefine who we are a little bit. We did that by taking time to write together instead of showing up and putting parts together. We felt our last record, &lt;em&gt;As Daylight Dies,&lt;/em&gt; sounded a little too much like &apos;us,&apos; if that makes sense. We want to reinvent ourselves while retaining the Killswitch Engage integrity.&quot; While so many bands approach Dutkiewicz to produce their records, asking him for that definable &quot;KsE sound,&quot; the goofy guitarist is modest about his work, saying, &quot;I guess we&apos;re doing something right. We like to sound good on record. Live, there might be some hijinx and too much to drink, but that&apos;s the rock show. When we put songs together on record, we want them to sound clean and the best they can be!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutkiewicz maintains that despite the bands change of routine, things were exciting in the camp. &quot;I don&apos;t want things to be a ho-hum. I want to be over the top,&quot; he says. &quot;We have attained a stature where we can afford to take risks now. That&apos;s not to say we will be a polka band or anything, but we can take risks, make good music and make fans happy or we will be out of jobs very quickly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality music is the order of the day on &lt;em&gt;Killswitch Engage. &lt;/em&gt;The band also wrote in a much more collaborative way. D&apos;Antonio says, &quot;Everyone pulled together as a team when we were writing and everyone contributed songs, which doesn&apos;t always happen on Killswitch records. I&apos;m spreading some of my Southern rock influence into the band. There was a little on the last record but there is more now. It&apos;s slow, dirgey, heavy stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drummer Justin Foley was able to contribute more to the process, saying, &quot;I didn&apos;t do any over thinking with my parts. When I did &lt;em&gt;Heartache,&lt;/em&gt; I was so new to the band that I was fitting into the band&apos;s mold and a lot of my crazy playing style doesn&apos;t work with Killswitch, so I had to adopt a new mindset. On &lt;em&gt;Daylight&lt;/em&gt;, I may have overthought. This time, I&apos;m so comfortable and know what we are, so the parts were natural this time around.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Stroetzel, the unsung hero of KsE who serves as the quiet force and complement to Dutkiewicz&apos;s showmanship, reflects on the band&apos;s career, saying, &quot;It&apos;s been a strange, long road. We didn&apos;t expect it in the beginning. It started as a weekend thing, with us jamming on Saturdays and playing occasional shows at bars, pubs, VFW halls.&amp;nbsp; It turned into more than we expected.&quot; For the new album, both guitarists experimented with sounds, tones and effects pedals, according to Stroetzel.&amp;nbsp; &quot;There&apos;s some more spacey, ambient stuff in the background, but not in the main parts,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s heavy and guitar-driven, but it&apos;s a lot more textured.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Jones contends that the change of pace was &quot;by no means easy, but I&apos;ve enjoyed the process. I like the challenge, that&apos;s one of the most enjoyable things about being in a band, getting to be creative in a way that a lot people don&apos;t get to be in normal, every day jobs.&quot; As for the impact KsE have left on the current hard rock scene, Jones and the band are modest, humble even, about their role.&amp;nbsp; Jones says, &quot;It&apos;s completely unexpected and in a lot of ways, not that much has changed about the band except we&apos;re not in a van anymore. It&apos;s still the same lunkheaded guys who get on stage and make fun of each other. Nothing has really changed, except we have a few more people who like us and we&apos;re lucky.&quot; While the band chalks it up to luck, talent and the crafting of good music that speaks to the fans also factor into the mix with Killswitch Engage and their new self-titled release&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Korn will never forget where they came from: a dark place where salvation arrives in the form of twisted, throbbing guitar riffs, syncopated chaotic funk beats, a schizophrenic bass thump and an unmistakable cathartic howl. Emerging from the depths of Bakersfield, California with a sound unlike any other in 1994, Korn have been able to cement themselves as one of the most important bands in rock n&apos; roll history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of eight full-length releases, Korn have sold in excess of 30 million albums and played countless sold-out shows worldwide. They&apos;ve won two Grammys&amp;mdash;one for Best Short Form Video for&amp;nbsp; &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; from 1998&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Follow the Leader&lt;/em&gt; and one for Best Metal Performance for &quot;Here to Stay,&quot; from 2002&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Untouchables&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;and have launched a massively successful festival of their own, &lt;em&gt;The Family Values Tour&lt;/em&gt;. However, despite all their massive success and accolades, Korn haven&apos;t lost hold of the savage, raw energy that made them such a crucial band for diehard rock and metal fans. Korn are one of the preeminent voices of this generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their ninth offering, &lt;em&gt;Korn III &amp;mdash;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt;, is their first effort for brand new label home, Roadrunner Records, and it bursts at the seams with that very feeling that defined the band from the get-go. Each song unleashes an uneasiness reminiscent of Korn&apos;s earliest and most unbridled material, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a modern refinement that&apos;s epic in its execution. &amp;nbsp;Korn definitely don&apos;t lose sight of their roots on &lt;em&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt;, but they also venture into uncharted darkness. All that truly matters is where they&apos;re going. The album strikes a balance between their past and their future, as it finds the band reuniting with producer Ross Robinson, who manned the boards for their first two records, all the while joining forces with Roadrunner Records, the world&amp;rsquo;s leading rock label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Korn III &amp;ndash; Remember Who You Are, &lt;/em&gt;it&apos;s their time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korn bleed with unsettling and unpredictable aggression on &lt;em&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt;&apos;s 10 tracks. &quot;Oildale (Leave Me Alone)&quot; buzzes with an eerie clean guitar that slowly gives way to a steamrolling bass and riff assault. &quot;Move On&quot; morphs from a myriad of creaking tones into an explosive vocal freak-out that&apos;s impossible not to connect with it on a visceral level. Then there&apos;s the neck-snapping &quot;Fear Is A Place to Live&quot; tempering deadly guitar dissonance with an unforgettable chorus. This is Korn reborn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This album is a reflection of us being a band since 1993,&quot; says vocalist Jonathan Davis. &quot;We worked hard on the previous records, and we experimented a lot. For &lt;em&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt;, the four of us got together in a small room with the intention of writing an old school Korn record. This album is a perfect mixture of everything we&apos;ve done, and this version of the band is the best ever.&quot; It&apos;s as if Korn revisited their storied beginnings, but as a wiser, tighter and more precise outfit blessed with the benefit of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to tap into the chaos that made their self-titled debut a modern classic, the band enlisted the help of the man who helmed &lt;em&gt;Korn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Life is Peachy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;producer Ross Robinson, whose goal was to bring Korn back to square one. He undoubtedly succeeded. Davis had an intense and invigorating recording session. &quot;Ross helped us remember what we used to do this for,&quot; the singer says. &quot;It was more psychological than anything. Ross was right there pushing me and he drove me insane. I sing about a lot of things that hit really close to my heart and he knew how to trigger that. I nearly fucking broke down at the end of almost every song, but I got it all out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer, the experience was no different. He elaborates, &quot;Teaming up with Ross has brought that raw, emotional feeling back to the music. Ross is the only person in the world that&apos;s ever been able to draw us to that place. He reminds us why we&apos;re here, why these songs are important to our fans and why what we do as a band relates. He made us remember how our music saves lives, and he came into the picture at the perfect time. We had no record label and just wanted to make a great album. Ross stepped in at the right moment to hit the reset button.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting that &quot;reset button&quot; involved stripping down the process. There would be no Pro-Tools, no tracking separately and no heavy post editing. In order to conjure &lt;em&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt;&apos;s claustrophobic yet wholly organic chaos, Korn recorded on two-inch tape and locked themselves inside a 10x10 room buried within their Los Angeles studio, nicknamed &quot;The Cat Box.&quot; Being in such close proximity to one another stirred up a torrent of explosive music. Bassist Reggie &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu remembers, &quot;In that room, even if I turned my bass head, it would hit somebody. Getting back in there was like a family reunion. We felt like brothers again. Being older and setting egos aside, we were able to focus on making the best record we could.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis dug deep for cuts like &quot;The Past&quot; and &quot;Never Around.&quot; About &quot;The Past,&quot; the singer says, &quot;A lot of people dwell on the past, and they feel guilt. There&apos;s nothing you can do about the past because it&apos;s gone and it&apos;s blown up. We&apos;re here now.&quot; On &lt;em&gt;Korn III &amp;ndash; Remember Who You Are, &lt;/em&gt;Davis is fully present and at his most vitriolic, violent and vibrant on the likes of &quot;Move On&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready to Live?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;He goes on, &quot;I let everything flow, while I was coming up with lyrics. They&apos;re about me living my life for others when I shouldn&apos;t, people-pleasing all of the time, stress, guilt and all kinds of emotions we live with everyday that destroy us and tear us down. I write about all of the fake people around us and how I always try to fix other people&apos;s problems. I write what I feel, and it comes out naturally. I&apos;ve got a lot of shit built up inside me; that doesn&apos;t go away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though Korn went back to square one, they continue to break new ground. In a career marked by innovation, they &lt;em&gt;still &lt;/em&gt;smash boundaries. Munky even fingerpicks certain instrumental passages, while trying out new tones on echo-y soundscapes. &quot;The heavier I play, the more you can hear the aggression. The lighter I pick, the lighter the mood is,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;I used vintage guitars, echos, long delays and reverbs. When we did the first two records, we broke the music down to a completely emotional beast. Through the years, we started to experiment with vocal harmonies and more orchestrated pieces. Recording this album, we brought that knowledge into the raw emotion of what we already knew. You hear the melodies and layers, but it still comes from a very primitive Korn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That primitive Korn includes drummer Ray Luzier, who became Korn&apos;s touring drummer in late 2007 and was made an official member in 2009. On cuts like the deadly &quot;Fear is a Place to Live,&quot; he propels the aggression. Fieldy says, &quot;Ray is like the missing Korn member we never had. He just fits so well. When we found him, it just clicked because his playing sounds like Korn. He plays with me, and the way that he plays is exactly what I needed. We know what we&apos;re doing on stage with each other, and everybody&apos;s on the same page. I&apos;ve waited my whole career for Korn to sound like we do now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korn may have changed members with Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch and David Silveria departing in 2005 and 2006 respectively, but Jonathan, Munky, Fieldy and Ray capture the feeling that was there in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Davis, the album name covers it all. &quot;It comes down to one question: &apos;Who the fuck am I?&apos; It&apos;s about remembering where we came from. The title sums up everything I&apos;m talking about lyrically. During the first two records, we were kids, and we didn&apos;t have anything. We were making music, having fun and not worrying. I went back to that place where I wasn&apos;t worried. I wanted to be completely honest with my feelings, express myself and let them out. People get so wrapped up in social communities, the Internet and technology that they forget who they are and what life&apos;s really about. I fucking forgot who I was until I did this record. This album is just a bass, a guitar, drums and my vocals. I look at the records we&apos;ve done as slots in time, and I believe &lt;em&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt; is very special.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album captures the band&apos;s legendary performance style that&apos;s ignited crowds worldwide on stages ranging from &lt;em&gt;OZZfest &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Projekt Revolution &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Woodstock&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Download&lt;/em&gt;. It&apos;s the same spirit that gave pop culture hits such as &quot;Blind,&quot; &quot;A.D.I.D.A.S.,&quot; &quot;Got the Life,&quot; &quot;Falling Away from Me&quot; and &quot;Twisted Transistor.&quot; It&amp;rsquo;s clear, however, that &lt;em&gt;Korn III &amp;ndash; Remember Who You Are &lt;/em&gt;is another thrilling chapter being etched into Korn&amp;rsquo;s already impressive history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s that timeless space that we enter where nothing else matters on stage,&quot; says Munky. &quot;It&apos;s us, the crowd and the music. We lose track of where we are and who we are, and it&apos;s just a timeless shared space between us and the audience. We lose ourselves in the music. I want fans to lose themselves in the new music by forgetting about any problems or anything going on in their minds and let their hearts hear it. It&apos;s the same experience that I get when I&apos;m on stage.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process brought them back to the beginning, but it also encouraged serious growth. Everyone is locked in like never before. Fieldy adds, &quot;We want to take you on a rollercoaster with this record. There are spacey and weird parts where the bass can breathe and there are some heavy moments. On &lt;em&gt;Remember Who You Are&lt;/em&gt;, I&apos;m doing what I really wanted to do on our first record.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, this is for the people that made Korn&amp;mdash;the millions of kids worldwide that buy every record, wear every shirt and never miss a show. Davis concludes, &quot;I love doing what I do. I love helping kids. I love hearing fans say, &apos;You got me through this or that.&apos; It makes me feel like I&apos;ve done something positive. I want kids to feel what I&apos;m saying and really hear it. I&apos;d love for the new songs to provoke them to think about what goes on around them. We&apos;re very fortunate to keep doing what we&apos;re doing, still be relevant and create music that invokes feelings from people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With music this powerful, no one will ever forget who Korn are.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Beyond the tragedy, the history, the raging guitars and the killer songs, ultimately, &lt;strong&gt;Lynyrd Skynyrd&lt;/strong&gt; is about an indomitable will. About survival of spirit; unbowed, uniquely American, stubbornly resolute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their first set of new studio material since 2003&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Vicious Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, legendary rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd returns with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Guns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, due out September 29 on &lt;strong&gt;Loud &amp;amp; Proud/Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt;. Recorded in Nashville in 2008-2009, the project was interrupted&amp;mdash;but, tellingly, not ended&amp;mdash;by the deaths of founding member/keyboardist &lt;strong&gt;Billy Powell&lt;/strong&gt; and longtime bassist &lt;strong&gt;Ean Evans&lt;/strong&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driven by core members &lt;strong&gt;Gary Rossington&lt;/strong&gt; (guitar), &lt;strong&gt;Johnny Van Zant&lt;/strong&gt; (vocals) and &lt;strong&gt;Rickey Medlocke&lt;/strong&gt; (guitar), along with longtime drummer &lt;strong&gt;Michael Cartellone&lt;/strong&gt;, Lynyrd Skynyrd have recorded an album (&amp;ldquo;under duress, as usual,&amp;rdquo; according to Van Zant) that very much lives up to the legacy begun some 35 years ago in Jacksonville, Florida, and halted for a decade by the 1977 plane crash that killed three band members, including Ronnie Van Zant and Steve Gaines. Since then, the band tragically lost Allen Collins, Leon Wilkeson and Huey Thomasson, yet they rock on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the passing of Powell and Evans, &amp;ldquo;a lot of people probably expected us to say enough is enough,&amp;rdquo; admits Medlocke.&amp;nbsp; But that would not be the way of this Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame powerhouse. With a catalog of over 60 albums and sales beyond 30 million, Lynyrd Skynyrd remains a cultural icon that appeals to all generations, and &lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Guns&lt;/em&gt; is a fitting addition to the canon. The &lt;em&gt;Skynyrd Nation&lt;/em&gt; awaits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We wanted to show the people that not only are we doing the old material, keeping the music going, but we still have some new tricks up our sleeves, too,&amp;rdquo; says founding guitarist Gary Rossington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to the studio after the death of Powell, whose keyboards can be heard on more than half the songs on &lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Guns&lt;/em&gt;, was &amp;ldquo;very difficult, I ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna lie to you,&amp;rdquo; says Van Zant. &amp;ldquo;But we got through it, as Lynyrd Skynyrd seems to always do. Music&amp;rsquo;s a great healer. These songs needed to be out there, this record needed to be made. Gary, Rickey and myself just said &amp;lsquo;let&amp;rsquo;s go for it, let&amp;rsquo;s get this thing done.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, coping with loss is familiar to this band. &amp;ldquo;We just kind of fell back in,&amp;rdquo; says Rossington. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this a long time, so you just kind of do what you do. As you get older, you get a little more used to it. You know it&amp;rsquo;s coming, and it&amp;rsquo;s coming to you, too. I just thank God for every day and all the time I had with the guys that aren&amp;rsquo;t with us anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crying is over and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to rock. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve had some really bad moments this year already, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad we&amp;rsquo;re able to pick ourselves up by our boot straps and just continue to play,&amp;rdquo; says Medlocke. &amp;ldquo;For us to weather through this makes this record even more special. I&amp;rsquo;m sure Billy and Ean are looking down upon us with big smiles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With noted rock producer &lt;strong&gt;Bob Marlette&lt;/strong&gt;, input from guitarist &lt;strong&gt;John 5&lt;/strong&gt;, and a wealth of material written by the band and a cadre of elite Skynyrd-minded songwriters, a remarkable album emerged. &amp;ldquo;We never really worked with producers that well, we kind of always wanted to do it our way,&amp;rdquo; admits Rossington. &amp;ldquo;But Bob Marlette came on and he&amp;rsquo;s such a great guy; he figured out how to talk to us musically, and we became friends instantly. He had a lot of fresh ideas and ways to do things, and also wanted to capture the old sounds, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of John 5, Rossington adds, &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the best guitar players I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played with, and I&amp;rsquo;ve played with a lot of great ones. He just lives with a guitar on him, and he knows that neck like nobody I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a backbone of Southern rock and country, passionate Van Zant vocals, and trademark layered guitars, &lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Guns&lt;/em&gt; manages to maintain the iconic Skynyrd punch while sounding completely contemporary. Sure to attract attention in these politically divided times is the title track, which harbors a sense of menace and unwillingness to back down that hearkens back to Skynyrd&amp;rsquo;s earliest days. The band knows the song, and others like &amp;ldquo;That Ain&amp;rsquo;t My America,&amp;rdquo; will have their critics, but Medlocke says listeners should get beyond the title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not just the words &amp;lsquo;God and guns.&amp;rsquo; you gotta look past that and look at what this country was founded on: freedom,&amp;rdquo; Medlocke says. &amp;ldquo;Everybody should be able to make their own decisions and not be led around by a nose ring and told what to do and when to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if some critics don&amp;rsquo;t like it, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s called freedom of choice,&amp;rdquo; says Medlocke, who carries his Native American heritage with pride. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sure some critics will look at it, &lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Guns&lt;/em&gt;, the rednecks are back.&amp;rsquo; Well, the guys in this band aren&amp;rsquo;t rednecks, Rickey Medlocke&amp;rsquo;s the only damn redneck in this band &amp;lsquo;cause I got red skin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title track, along with the unmistakable Skynyrd bite of the first single &amp;ldquo;Still Unbroken,&amp;rdquo; form thematic songs for an album laden with attitude, heart and purpose. &amp;ldquo;Skynyrd&amp;rsquo;s about tradition,&amp;rdquo; says Medlocke. &amp;ldquo;We are guys that don&amp;rsquo;t go around preaching about our own personal or political beliefs, although I&amp;rsquo;m sure you could probably guess mine. In this record is personal tragedy, personal relationships and being on the road, all under that umbrella of real life. That&amp;rsquo;s what we think, that&amp;rsquo;s what we believe, and we stand next to that title, &lt;em&gt;God &amp;amp; Guns&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To portray Skynyrd as a bunch of &amp;ldquo;gun nuts&amp;rdquo; would be incorrect, according to Van Zant. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m kind of like Ronnie, &amp;lsquo;handguns are made for killing,&amp;rsquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen anybody shoot a deer with a .38,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;I do own a bunch of rifles, I live out in the swamp, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got to protect yourself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skynyrd is a band, after all, that has never shied away from standing up and speaking for a segment of the population whose voices are seldom heard. &amp;ldquo;Everybody&amp;rsquo;s so scared to say stuff these days, that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m about,&amp;rdquo; says Van Zant. &amp;ldquo;We live in America, we can speak our minds. These are our values. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean we&amp;rsquo;re always right in everybody&amp;rsquo;s mind. Hopefully, we don&amp;rsquo;t offend a bunch of people. And if we do, well, get a record deal, man, and make your own songs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a band well aware of the responsibility that comes with putting the name &amp;lsquo;Lynyrd Skynyrd&amp;rsquo; on anything, be it an album or a concert. &amp;ldquo;We feel like we have to keep the standards high,&amp;rdquo; says Rossington. &amp;ldquo;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t put this record out, I&amp;rsquo;d fight not to, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t think it was good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so Skynyrd stands, &amp;ldquo;still unbroken,&amp;rdquo; in 2009. &amp;ldquo;People may say, &amp;lsquo;they need the money,&amp;rsquo; well I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of us need the money,&amp;rdquo; Van Zant says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just that we love the music, it&amp;rsquo;s bigger than the money, it&amp;rsquo;s not even about that any more. We have to make a living, sure, but it&amp;rsquo;s about the legacy of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and what it stands for, what the fans are all about. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like getting out there playing a great show with Skynyrd and seeing people love this music.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adds Rossington, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re still standing, still keeping the music going. We wanted to do the guys who aren&amp;rsquo;t with us any more proud, and keep the name proud, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             How do you create a masterpiece of modern metal?&amp;nbsp; Is it a conscious effort on the part of the artists or is it something more organic - a confluence of events and moods, emotions and mechanics that all come together in the right place at the right time?&amp;nbsp; That&amp;#39;s the question that comes to mind upon the first listen to &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s sixth studio album &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;Guitars rip, drums pound, bass thunders and lyrics resonate as the Bay Area quartet soars past the bar set by its critically-lauded predecessor &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through the Ashes of Empires&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;If &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empires&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was the sounding of the trumpet, then &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the arrival of the hordes: dense, aggressive and inescapable. &lt;p&gt;Produced once again by singer/guitarist Robb Flynn&amp;nbsp;(&lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner United&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt;) and mixed by Colin Richardson (Bullet For My Valentine, Funeral For A Friend), &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pushes the band&amp;#39;s groundbreaking sound farther than it&amp;#39;s ever gone before.&amp;nbsp; Challenging themselves and each other to write a record that would demolish all of their boundaries, the band has delivered 60 minutes of the most structurally complex and technical material that &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; has ever recorded.&amp;nbsp; Three part guitar and bass harmonies, dueling solos, and savage thrash intricacy sit alongside soaring 3 part vocal harmonies, ultimately crashing head first into bludgeoning, Neanderthal riffage. &amp;quot;Pushing ourselves came pretty naturally with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;After writing&amp;nbsp;songs like &amp;quot;Imperium,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Vim&amp;quot; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Days Turn Blue To Gray&amp;quot; on the last album,&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;felt really comfortable magnifying the complexity of our&amp;nbsp;songs and it really shows on this album,&amp;quot; exclaims drummer Dave McClain. That fact becomes brilliantly obvious after listening to just the first few minutes of album opener &amp;quot;Clenching the Fists of Dissent.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Yet, those &amp;quot;first few minutes&amp;quot; are merely a portion of what the ten-minute epic has in store for the listener, serving both literally and figuratively as the war cry for the record and setting the stage for the colossal statement that is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting alongside the band&amp;#39;s monstrous musical effort are Robb&amp;#39;s gritty, streetwise lyrics which teeter effortlessly between brutal metal shouting and lush, melodic singing.&amp;nbsp; Going from what has recently been a more introspective focus, the words that grace &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; return to the socially-conscious narrative so prevalent throughout their earlier albums, focusing heavily on issues that touch one and all.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;The nature of the times during the writing of this album led to a very dismal atmosphere throughout... this is far and away the darkest material that we&amp;#39;ve ever written&amp;quot; states Flynn.&amp;nbsp; With lyrics that refuse to tread lightly when it comes to politics, war and organized religion, Robb spits anger and disdain in the truest spirit of the angst that fueled early 80&amp;#39;s punk rock.&amp;nbsp; Songs such as the aforementioned opener &amp;quot;Clenching the Fists of Dissent,&amp;quot; the massive &amp;quot;Halo&amp;quot; and epic album closer &amp;quot;A Farewell To Arms&amp;quot; attest to that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing the theme, &amp;quot;Aesthetics of Hate&amp;quot; captures the band&amp;#39;s anger towards a story that surfaced right after the tragic death of Dimebag Darrell that bashed both the legendary guitarist and the metal community as a whole.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Now I Lay Thee Down&amp;quot; plays like a twisted Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet with its own ugly ending. &amp;quot;Slanderous&amp;quot; addresses the hate and name-calling&amp;nbsp;that still permeates throughout society, even in today&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;PC&amp;quot; climate.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Beautiful Mourning&amp;quot; speaks to the lowest of low points in a life, while &amp;quot;Wolves&amp;quot; references the strength and power of the pack, speaking to Machine Head&amp;#39;s rabid fans as well as the band itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with good reason; to witness &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; live is to understand both their unique internal chemistry and the undeniable bond that the band shares with its audience. With a performance that has been honed and strengthened through nearly nine years of non-stop worldwide touring, &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; are touted by many as the best live band in metal. &amp;nbsp;Oftentimes one can barely hear the band perform over the din of the audience singing along to favorites, new and old alike. Tickets for the band&amp;#39;s recent sold-out U.K. tour elicited bids in excess of $300 per pair on eBay and had bootleggers selling rip-offs of frontman Robb Flynn&amp;#39;s coveted &amp;quot;FUCT&amp;quot; stage T-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One can fully appreciate the band&amp;#39;s current level of success by looking back on their less-than-glamorous beginnings:&amp;nbsp; beer-fueled rehearsals in an Oakland warehouse that they shared with 4 punk rock bands, playing their first parties, local shows (some members not even old enough at the time to get into the 21+ clubs they were booked in) with the likes of Rancid, Deftones and Napalm Death. To spread the word, &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; took guerrilla marketing into their own hands, relentlessly flyering high schools and stickering unsuspecting cars at metal and punk shows. The band&amp;#39;s first demo - recorded for $800 in a friend&amp;#39;s bedroom, with their amps in the bathroom - was a very rough estimation of their burgeoning sound, a combination of the aggression of metal and punk, and the social anger of urban rap, intertwined with hypnotic Alice In Chains-esque vocal harmonies. It was this demo that eventually made it into the hands of Roadrunner Records, setting into motion the course of events that would lead to the 1994 release of their groundbreaking debut, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn My Eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resplendent with some of the heaviest guitar tones ever heard in metal (thanks to their pioneering use of a dropped B tuning, and Peavey 5150 amplifiers - virtually unknown prior to &lt;em&gt;BME&lt;/em&gt;) and released the same year as such seminal albums as Pantera&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Far Beyond Driven&lt;/em&gt;, AFI&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&lt;/em&gt; and In Flames&amp;#39; &lt;em&gt;Subterranean&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn My Eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; crashed head-first into the then-barren metal world.&amp;nbsp; Critical praise overseas, combined with 17 months of non-stop touring (including 5 months with Slayer), a U.S. headline tour that had them booked at every pool hall, strip bar, and rock club in America, a European headline tour that had them booked in the very same venues they had just supported Slayer, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burn My Eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; went on to become the biggest-selling debut in the history of Roadrunner Records at the time, and would soon serve as the template for much of the &amp;#39;metalcore&amp;#39; sound that dominates the aggressive music market today.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their annihilating follow-up &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The More Things Change...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; would see the band expand their trademark sound, pushing the envelope even further. Several high-profile tours in America followed, including Ozzfest (which saw the band flirt with expulsion after starting an on-stage grass-throwing riot in Detroit), firmly established Machine Head as a live draw to be reckoned with. Unfortunately, the bands&amp;#39; hard drinking reputation and dependence on alcohol and drugs began to get the best of them.&amp;nbsp; Then-guitarist Logan Mader would quit the band, and Flynn would enter therapy soon afterward to deal with his own problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choosing to face his demons head on, the frontman confronted his issues through his lyrics. Rather than lashing out at society, he exorcised his own personal demons, purging his psychological wounds on the emotionally-charged shockwave that was their 3rd album,&lt;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The Burning Red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Flynn&amp;#39;s confessions on the songs &amp;quot;Five&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Burning Red&amp;quot; were lyrical scars torn wide open, revealing dark truths that he had yet to even share with many of his closest friends. This heightened lyrical heft lent itself to even greater musical experimentation, with the band incorporating such lesser known influences as The Cure, and the guitar psychedelics of Jimi Hendrix into their healthy dose of metal.&amp;nbsp; Bassist Adam Duce agrees, &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Burning Red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was a brave and pretty bold step forward.&amp;nbsp; We felt like we had kind of backed ourselves into a corner after &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The More Things Change...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, so we decided to take some risks, screw playing it safe.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The risk paid off, with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Burning Red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; allowing &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; to expand its fan base outside of the metal genre in the U.S., and abroad.&amp;nbsp; Subsequent tours of the U.S., and again more dates with Slayer in such far-away places as Korea, Japan, Australia, and Europe,&amp;nbsp;would take the band to previously un-scaled heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the band&amp;#39;s 4th effort &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supercharger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; would produce such live concert favorites as &amp;quot;Bulldozer&amp;quot; and the harrowing &amp;quot;Trephination&amp;quot; - a fact solidly reinforced on their follow-up live album &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HellaLive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (recorded at a sold-out 5000-capacity concert at London&amp;#39;s Brixton Academy) - as well as include two U.S. headlining tours, their first-ever festival headlining appearance at Germany&amp;#39;s With Full Force Festival, and a slot at Japan&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Beast Feast&amp;quot; festival, both the band and fans alike felt that &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; could push themselves harder, challenging themselves to forge something that was once again fresh and innovative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter 2003&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through the Ashes of Empires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Hailed by critics and fans alike as a metal masterpiece, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through the Ashes of Empires&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; went on to become the 2nd-best selling record for Roadrunner Records Europe that year.&amp;nbsp; Six months later in the Spring of 2004, the album saw its U.S. release, also via Roadrunner. The album debuted at #88 on the Billboard Top 200 (tying &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s highest debut ever) and their follow-up live DVD &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elegies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bullied its way to #13 on the U.S. Billboard charts, and #4 on the U.K. charts.&amp;nbsp; Their three U.S. headline tours of clubs and small theaters (garnering a direct support slot for Lamb Of God on select U.S. dates) and their two European headline tours of large and small theaters achieved stellar numbers, selling out nearly all shows in major markets throughout both continents. The band&amp;#39;s European summer festival run included blistering appearances at Germany&amp;#39;s Rock Am Ring / Rock Am Park (as direct support to Korn and Evanescence), a show-stealing Donington performance as direct support to Slipknot and Metallica, prompting fans to vote &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Best Band of the Day&amp;quot; on Download&amp;#39;s official U.K. website, and finally, a headlining slot atop Germany&amp;#39;s prestigious Wacken festival (with the fans once again electing &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Best Band of the Festival&amp;quot; on Wacken&amp;#39;s official website), would wrap up what was nothing short of a spectacular run for the band. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little did anyone know what they had in store... with lead guitarist Phil Demmel firmly entrenched in the ranks, and drummer Dave McClain practicing upwards of 7 hours a day, the band re-entered the studio with a near-insatiable hunger and new thirst to create.&amp;nbsp; Guitarist Phil Demmel notes, &amp;quot;Since I was only in the band long enough to&amp;nbsp;contribute to a few songs for &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;, I really wanted to put a signature Flynn/Demmel stamp on this albums&amp;#39; material. &amp;nbsp;We really pushed each other with the riff interplay and the harmony solos to a&amp;nbsp;high point in this bands&amp;#39; history.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Singer/guitarist Robb Flynn echoes that sentiment, stating that &amp;quot;In many ways this was the most important record of our career. We needed to make a record that was fearless in its ability to embrace, but not be limited by what we had accomplished before. &amp;nbsp;All of our musical heroes have made monumental records that didn&amp;#39;t necessarily go with the evolution of their band; a perfect example would be The Cure from &lt;em&gt;Pornography&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Disintegration&lt;/em&gt;, or Metallica from &lt;em&gt;Kill &amp;lsquo;em All&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Master of Puppets&lt;/em&gt;. Those bands destroyed their drawing board and reconstructed it.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is that fearlessness that has allowed &lt;strong&gt;Machine He&lt;/strong&gt;ad to make music that is daring, true and honest.&amp;nbsp; Never creating the same album twice, they&amp;#39;ve stuck their necks out numerous times, always looking to push the envelope just a little further.&amp;nbsp; And while any time you take a risk, some results may fare better than others, there&amp;#39;s one thing you can always be sure of - the &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; album you&amp;#39;re listening to is the album they wanted to create. Compromise has never been an option for &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; With &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, that same creed of indomitable passion and unflinching sincerity has brought us the genuine article, having yet again set a new high watermark for themselves as well as the genre.&amp;nbsp; Don&amp;#39;t let the name fool you... &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Blackening&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is, without a doubt, &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s brightest moment.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Roadrunner Records is pleased to announce the signing of Charleston, South Carolina rock band MADAM ADAM. The band is currently finishing up the recording of their as-yet untitled Roadrunner debut in Nashville, Tennessee, where they are working with producer/mixer Skidd Mills (Saving Abel, Saliva, Skillet, Sick Puppies.) Roadrunner expects to release the album in summer of 2010, and the band will be announcing some Southeast tour dates shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band - vocalist/guitarist Scott Gould, bassist Kenny Varner, guitarist Drew Reindollar and drummer Matthew Reindollar - has posted webisodes from the studio sessions on their MySpace page, which are viewable here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roadrunner Senior VP of A&amp;amp;R Ron Burman commented about the signing, saying, &quot;I&apos;m really excited to be working with Madam Adam. They have really catchy rock songs, the kind that I grew up listening to on rock radio. Madam Adam write songs that stick in your head after one listen, which is rare. The singer, Scott, has a great voice and they are an exceptionally good live band.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re grateful for the opportunity to work with Ron Burman and the staff at Roadrunner -- to have such an accomplished team behind us is that dream every kid with a guitar hopes becomes a reality,&quot; Gould said. &quot;Last week, we laid the final tracks to the debut, thanks in part to producer Skidd &apos;The Wizard&apos; Mills and at the moment we&apos;re describing it as Casablanca starring Conan the Barbarian.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Some people think big. Some people think huge. And then there&apos;s Meat Loaf.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For the past 35 years, the man born Marvin Lee Aday has been a towering monument on the musical landscape.&amp;nbsp; His legendary 1977 album &lt;strong&gt;Bat Out Of Hell&lt;/strong&gt; transformed this former high school football player, nightclub bouncer and stage actor into one of the great American rock &apos;n&apos; roll icons. That record, with its staggering operatic sound and impassioned vocals, has sold more than 43 million albums worldwide - still one of the biggest-selling records of all time.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Meat Loaf&apos;s reputation as one of music&apos;s greatest artists was underlined by such masterpieces as &lt;strong&gt;Dead Ringer&lt;/strong&gt; (1981), &lt;strong&gt;Bad Attitude&lt;/strong&gt; (1984) and the &lt;strong&gt;Bat Out Of Hell &lt;/strong&gt;sequels &lt;strong&gt;Bat Out Of Hell II: Back Into Hell&lt;/strong&gt; (1993) and &lt;strong&gt;Bat Out Of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose &lt;/strong&gt;(2006). Other artists might have tried to match his scale and copy his sound, but no one has come close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now, more than 30 years after he exploded onto the world stage, Meat Loaf is back with a new record, &lt;strong&gt;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&lt;/strong&gt; (a title taken from a line in the classic Russ Meyer trash movie &amp;ldquo;Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls&amp;rdquo;). From opener &amp;ldquo;Peace On Earth&amp;rdquo; to closer &amp;ldquo;Elvis In Vegas,&amp;rdquo; its 13 tracks drag the classic Meat Loaf sound kicking and screaming into the 21st century.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;I wanted it big, I wanted it dramatic, I wanted a rock record,&quot; says Meat Loaf. &quot;Yes, it sounds like a Meat Loaf record. But it sounds different too - it sounds new, it sounds fresh. It speaks to you in a different way.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Much of this newfound energy can be put down to Meat Loaf&apos;s working relationship with his new collaborator, producer Rob Cavallo (Green Day, My Chemical Romance Paramore, Fleetwood Mac). For the singer, it was a chance to work with one of the hottest producers around. For Cavallo, it was an opportunity to work with a childhood hero and a proper rock &apos;n&apos; roll legend.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;Rob is the Number 1 rock producer in the world because he leaves his ego out of the equation and gives an artist his voice, making it sound better than the artist could even imagine,&quot; says Meat. &quot;I was like a fisherman looking for a big mouthed bass. I put on the right worm. The first song I played to him, I hooked him. The second song, I nailed him.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The pair hit it off immediately, and this electrifying creative partnership immediately raised the bar several feet. Meat Loaf brought more than 40 songs to the table, which the duo whittled down to the 13 that appear on the final record, including the furious &amp;ldquo;Living On The Outside&amp;rdquo; and hilarious &amp;ldquo;LosAngeloser.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But there was one other piece to the jigsaw: Los Angeles-based screenwriter and director Kilian Kerwin, a long-time friend of the singer. As with every classic Meat Loaf album, &lt;strong&gt;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&lt;/strong&gt; has a bigger concept. It was one of Kerwin&apos;s short stories that inspired the singer to come up with the album&apos;s striking narrative.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;It&apos;s the story of a soldier,&quot; reveals Meat Loaf. &quot;He&apos;s been in battle and he&apos;s lying face down on the ground. He can&apos;t move, but he turns his head and starts to see blood run across the ground, and so he thinks he&apos;s going to die. They always say you see your life flash backwards you when you&apos;re about to die. But his life flashes forward - into what possibly could happen. He sees what his life could be - the good and the bad. The songs are the different scenarios he finds himself in. It&apos;s not always the same time or the same place - but it&apos;s always the same woman. But I don&apos;t want to give too much away - I want people to work it out for themselves.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; To flesh out his vision, Meat Loaf enlisted a set of elite musicians to play on the album, including guitarists Tim Pierce, Darkness frontman Justin Hawkins (who co-wrote two songs for the album),&amp;nbsp;Paul Crook and Randy Flowers, legendary bass players Chris Chaney and Kasim Sulton, genius keyboardist Jamie Mulhoberac and the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest rock drummer&amp;nbsp;(just ask Rob Cavallo) John Micelli. &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&lt;/strong&gt; also features a stellar array of big-name guests, including Steve Vai (who appears on &amp;ldquo;Love is Not Real&amp;rdquo;), former Queen guitarist Brian May (who appears on &amp;ldquo;Song Of Madness&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Love Is Not Real&amp;rdquo;), American Idol presenter Kara DioGuardi (who co-wrote and sings on &amp;ldquo;If I Can&apos;t Have You&amp;rdquo;) and Hollywood star Jack Black, who duets with Meat Loaf on &amp;ldquo;Like A Rose.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most surprising guest is Hugh Laurie - the English actor famous for starring in &lt;em&gt;Blackadder&lt;/em&gt; and hit US TV show &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;. It was while making a guest appearance on the latter that Meat Loaf met Laurie and discovered that he was a classically-trained pianist. What else could he do but ask the actor to play piano on the song &amp;ldquo;If I Can&apos;t Have You?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;He was really nervous at first,&quot; recalls Meat Loaf. &quot;It was strange seeing someone so confident on a TV set walk into the studio like he&apos;s a quivering mess. But he nailed it. He&apos;s talking about playing it with us if we ever go on &lt;em&gt;American Idol&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &quot;What I love about&amp;nbsp;Hugh, Jack and Kara,&quot; says Meat Loaf. &quot;Is that sometimes you get people coming to the studio, and they have their manager and a bodyguard and an entourage - it&apos;s this endless stream of people. The 3 of them, they just drove up to the studio in their own cars, no bullshit no fronts, just real people. &amp;nbsp;And I love real people.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But for all the star guests, &lt;strong&gt;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&lt;/strong&gt; is Meat Loaf&apos;s album &amp;ndash; his own dirty little secret. More than four decades into his career, the man - and his voice - is as big, bold and important as ever.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;How do I keep the fire burning?&quot; he asks. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I just do. I&apos;d bet in advance that if I sat with somebody in a room and said to them, &apos;I&apos;ll give you five pounds if you don&apos;t go &apos;Whoah!&apos; after the first song&apos;, they&apos;d forget about the five pounds and they&apos;d go &apos;Whoah!&apos;. You can&apos;t help it. And it&apos;s like that across all the songs. This record is spectacular!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a rare thing when a musician comes face to face with what made them great to begin with.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENDGAME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is that moment for &lt;strong&gt;Dave Mustaine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Megadeth&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s the record where it all comes full circle in a career that has set not only set standards in hard rock and metal, but defined them.&amp;nbsp; Megadeth are rage on a tight rein, as precise and beautifully destructive as a laser guided missile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After the smoke had cleared from personnel and label changes, I knew that regaining respect for me and for Megadeth was going to be a huge undertaking,&amp;rdquo; says Mustaine of the process re-tooling Megadeth after what is considered the &amp;ldquo;classic&amp;rdquo; line-up. &amp;ldquo;It was much like trying to turn a battleship -- no, more like an aircraft carrier-- around.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mission accomplished on &lt;em&gt;ENDGAME, &lt;/em&gt;which&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is as extreme as anything Megadeth has ever recorded. The album&amp;rsquo;s signature track &amp;ldquo;Head Crusher&amp;rdquo; should not merely serve as a wake-up for old fans but also a new generation ready to keep Mustaine &amp;amp; Co.&amp;rsquo;s brand of shredding guitar and bellicose songsmanship at the forefront of today&amp;rsquo;s metal scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, however, is not surprising for the man who has created and branded &amp;ldquo;Gigantour,&amp;rdquo; which for the past three years has united some of metal&amp;rsquo;s most musically literate players including Dream Theater, Children of Bodom and Opeth.&amp;nbsp; Then again, what else would one expect from someone who culled a sound from The New Wave of British Heavy Metal and created metal&amp;rsquo;s then new chic, which was state of the art speed metal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Megadeth machine is built on a blueprint of stark, complex musicianship. Over time, with album sales nearing 25 million worldwide, Mustaine has balanced rabid-dog aggression with staggering song-craft. The albums &lt;em&gt;Killing Is My Business&amp;hellip;And Business Is Good!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Peace Sells&amp;hellip;But Who&amp;rsquo;s Buying?&lt;/em&gt; , &lt;em&gt;So Far&amp;hellip;So Good&amp;hellip;So What?&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Countdown to Extinction&lt;/em&gt; remain true metal classics. No surprise then that Mustaine was awarded the title of &amp;ldquo;Riff Lord&amp;rdquo; at 2008&amp;rsquo;s Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards in the U.K, or that he was crowned &amp;ldquo;Golden God&amp;rdquo; at the 2009 Revolver Golden Gods Awards in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Which of course shouldn&amp;rsquo;t negate the flirting with commercial success on &lt;em&gt;Youthanasia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cryptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Writings&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Risk&lt;/em&gt;. Or even Megadeth&amp;rsquo;s road back to the standing at the top of metal&amp;rsquo;s top players with &lt;em&gt;World Needs a Hero&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The System Has Failed&lt;/em&gt; and their Roadrunner debut, &lt;em&gt;United Abominations&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;It was a good lesson about the need to follow your heart,&amp;rdquo; says Dave of the creative process with &lt;em&gt;Endgame.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;I am grateful to have fans who have let me stretch my wings musically. But this is where I am most comfortable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Dave Mustaine has nothing to prove. To make the record he wanted, Mustaine found himself building a full-blown recording studio in San Marcos, California, just outside of San Diego, dubbed &amp;ldquo;Vic&amp;rsquo;s Garage&amp;rdquo; after Megadeth&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;iconic, skull-faced mascot Vic Rattlehead. His rationale for building a studio for Megadeth was simple: &amp;ldquo;When we went into the studio last time it was too expensive, too extravagant, too arrogant and I think it made us a little lazy,&amp;rdquo; muses Mustaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Sneap,&amp;nbsp;metal-producer&amp;nbsp;and mixer par-excellence and a Megadeth cohort from &lt;em&gt;United Abominations&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;returned to work alongside of Mustaine. The result of this metal-mongering synergy speaks for itself. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a great relationship,&amp;rdquo; says Mustaine of his ongoing dealings with the acclaimed British producer, also known for his work with Killswitch Engage and Machine Head.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;We had a few intense moments, but that is part of having a real working relationship. I am a better guitarist, singer and producer due to my tremendous respect for Andy and my open ears when he is listening or isn&amp;rsquo;t listening to my point of view.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of Megadeth&amp;rsquo;s new energies on &lt;em&gt;ENDGAME &lt;/em&gt;goes to the induction of guitarist Chris Broderick, who joins Mustaine, drummer Shawn Drover and bassist James LoMenzo in the &amp;lsquo;Megs tightest line-up in years.&amp;nbsp; Mustaine even went on record to say, &amp;ldquo;With this album, I am also very excited to be introducing my new lead guitarist, Chris Broderick, to the world. I have always felt lucky to have had top shredders in that position, but after touring with Chris in support of my last album, I couldn&apos;t wait to get into the studio and see what he could do.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Not one to keep an exactly cheery lyrical stance, &lt;em&gt;ENDGAME &lt;/em&gt;finds Mustaine more scalding and articulate than ever. Sure, there&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;1,320&amp;rdquo;, a paean to the thrills of nitro funny car racing, but from there, it grows darker and darker. The Edgar Allen Poe waxing &amp;ldquo;The Hardest Part of Letting Go&amp;hellip;Sealed With A Kiss&amp;rdquo; finds the narrator entombing his beloved in a wall of bricks whilst Broderick shifts from beautific acoustics to Megadeth&amp;rsquo;s riffy snarl.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s a landscape of bitter realities where Mustaine&amp;rsquo;s lyrics resonate. &amp;ldquo;Bite The Hand That Feeds&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Right To Go Insane&amp;rdquo; delve into an economically disenfranchised nation of have and have-nots. Mustaine himself is no stranger to politics, a self-admitted CNN junkie who in 1992 was MTV&amp;rsquo;s floor commentator at the National Democratic Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENDGAME&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; title track is Mustaine at his darkest. &quot;Thematically, I&apos;ve never been known to be a silent bystander in a world that needs our participation,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;lsquo;Endgame&amp;rsquo; specifically is a document signed into law that further strips away personal civil rights. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a bill that George W. Bush had signed into law that could put an American citizen in a prison, much like a concentration camp,&amp;rdquo; states Mustaine. Far-fetched?&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musically and lyrically&amp;nbsp; Dave Mustaine remains metal&amp;rsquo;s true iconoclast whose latest musical offering rumbles with the intensity his career has been built on. Megadeth has come full circle. Megadeth are back to the killing business&amp;hellip;and business has never been better.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t logical but it made complete sense. &lt;strong&gt;Tommy Lee&lt;/strong&gt; has rocked every continent multiple times, he&amp;rsquo;s sold millions of records with &lt;strong&gt;M&amp;ouml;tley Cr&amp;uuml;e&lt;/strong&gt; and on his own; he&amp;rsquo;s done everything a musician dreams of doing. Except this: he&amp;rsquo;d never made a record with &lt;em&gt;the entire world&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;This really was one of the most incredible experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve had making a record, other than the first time I made a record - because there&amp;rsquo;s nothing quite like popping your cherry!&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; says.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;This record was the craziest thing ever. Parts were sent in from all over the world by people wanting to participate in the first once-in-a-lifetime global collaboration. It was insane dude!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is the second &lt;strong&gt;Methods of Mayhem&lt;/strong&gt; album, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Public Disservice Announcement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the first truly collaborative effort an artist of Tommy&amp;rsquo;s magnitude has ever dared to attempt. The concept came easy, the execution did not - it took time, technology, patience and dedication. The first step was to set the parameters. &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; and his team, including producer &lt;strong&gt;Scott Humphrey&lt;/strong&gt;, singer-guitarist &lt;strong&gt;J3&lt;/strong&gt; and others, wrote and recorded the songs, which ran the gamut from hard rock anthems to ballads to dance tracks. Then they made the core components of each song available for download on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepublicrecord.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.thepublicrecord.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who wished to add their playing or otherwise re-interpret the music however they saw fit. &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; listened to every single submission that was uploaded, chose the best, and integrated the actual audio tracks into the album&amp;rsquo;s final cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Some people were confused because no one has attempted anything like this before,&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; says. &amp;ldquo;I got a lot of emails asking me if they&amp;rsquo;d get songwriting credit if their part was used. That wasn&amp;rsquo;t the case, because all of these songs were already written and recorded.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s not to say that the many contributors will remain anonymous, however.&amp;nbsp; Every single musician whose part was used is credited and thanked on the album.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Credit doesn&amp;rsquo;t always happen in the music industry - or any industry - when you&amp;rsquo;re starting out,&amp;rdquo; Tommy says.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;And it hardly ever happens the first time you do something. I&amp;rsquo;ve done plenty of things for the credit, not the check, so I made sure that all of the people who sent us things we used were called out for their work. Take it from me - credit lasts forever, money doesn&amp;rsquo;t!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The song files were made available on &lt;strong&gt;The Public Record&lt;/strong&gt; on October 5th, 2009. By the end of the submission period in February, 2010, the page was viewed over 1 million times and over 10,000 submissions were uploaded. The music&lt;strong&gt; Tommy &lt;/strong&gt;received was all recorded in ProTools, Logic or Garage Band. And if a would-be collaborator had none of those, they were able to download a program called Riff Works for free from the website.&amp;nbsp; What came back once the public got its hands on the raw ingredients was &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; all over the map - just as &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were techno tracks sent in from the foothills of Osaka, Japan, there were hand drum rhythms sent in from India and searing guitar solos sent from as close to home as San Diego. There were also plenty of sounds to confuse and boggle the mind. &amp;ldquo;Some crazy dude from Prague I think it was, sent in a spoken word track that had nothing at all to do with the song,&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; says. &amp;ldquo;It was this bit about &amp;lsquo;the cow&amp;rsquo;s moon being in the sky, parting the broken winds of the clouds of the sea.&amp;rsquo; I turned to my producer and was like, &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what he&amp;rsquo;s talking about but I want what he&amp;rsquo;s got!&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his work outside of the &lt;strong&gt;Cr&amp;uuml;e&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; always challenges himself musically, so the greatest side effect of this project was his exposure to so many new ideas. &amp;ldquo;When you hear something totally left field,&amp;rdquo; he says, &amp;ldquo;you realize that someone is hearing the same song so differently than you are. It makes you think about how you wrote it - and there are pros and cons to that.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; One of the pros, was that the song&lt;strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Back to Before,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; which started out as a rock song, ended up as a dance song. &amp;ldquo;This guy from France sent in this complete re-edit - he made it into a full-on dance track. Anyone who knows me at all knows I love dance music, so when I heard it, that was it! It threw the song into a full 360&amp;deg;. We pumped the brakes and started over.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt;, along with his producer and band listened to about 1500 submissions a week - over 200 a day.&amp;nbsp; For all of the memorable oddballs, there was an over-abundance of talent. &amp;ldquo;There is a lot of undiscovered talent out there, from kids just getting started, to shirt-tuckers who have a 9 to 5 that just rock out in a bar band on the weekends. They don&amp;rsquo;t want to be famous, but those guys are stars.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s greatest reward, however, was the appreciation he received for giving those unsung heroes a chance. &amp;ldquo;I got so many emails thanking me for the opportunity,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;I kept thinking of myself at 15. If Led Zeppelin had put tracks online and I&amp;rsquo;d ripped a few beats in my parents garage, sent them in and they&amp;rsquo;d used them? I would have died!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the project is called &lt;strong&gt;Methods of Mayhem&lt;/strong&gt;, it bears little resemblance to its first incarnation - except for the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s unlike anything else you&amp;rsquo;ll hear this year. &amp;ldquo;When I founded Methods in 1999, the whole purpose of the band was to be all over the place,&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;Tommy&lt;/strong&gt; says. &amp;ldquo;And in keeping with that, this Methods isn&amp;rsquo;t anything like the last one. There&amp;rsquo;s no hip hop and there&amp;rsquo;s no roster of guest stars. This time, it&amp;rsquo;s me, my band, and the world.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; When &lt;strong&gt;Methods of Mayhem&lt;/strong&gt; brings&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A Public Disservice Announcement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on tour to the public that helped make it later this year, expect more of the unexpected.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s some technology out there right now video- and lighting-wise that is blowing my mind,&amp;rdquo; Tommy says.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I do a rock band with M&amp;ouml;tley. Methods is not going to be that kind of set up. I want something like Daft Punk but unique to this. I want a real robot playing bass. I want the show to start at the mixing board. I want to do everything you&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to do and hope it works. This is going to be something else, something I&amp;rsquo;ve never done before - &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; my goal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album&amp;rsquo;s highlights include the ominous techno of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Party Instructions,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; the sexy, mechanical funk of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;All I Wanna Do,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; the hilarious rave-up &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Drunk Uncle Pete&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and the propulsive intensity of&lt;strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;Fight Song.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; One of the album&amp;rsquo;s first singles, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Time Bomb,&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong&gt;however, is the jewel in the crown. The introspective rock anthem&amp;rsquo;s infectious sing-along chorus will confound those who think they know what to expect from Tommy Lee - which is just what the doctor ordered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Rock &apos;n&apos; roll is dangerous again, thanks to &lt;strong&gt;Murderdolls &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Women and Children Last&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, their sophomore album for Roadrunner Records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due out this August, &lt;em&gt;Women and Children Last&lt;/em&gt; is a dirty dose of whiskey-soaked riffs, satanically sleazy solos and infectiously invasive choruses.&amp;nbsp; Which means it&amp;rsquo;s what the Murderdolls do best, but even better (and filthier) this time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undeniable pairing of Slipknot&apos;s Joey Jordison [guitar, drums] and Wednesday 13 [vocals, guitar] is more precisely pissed-off than ever before. Joey and Wednesday tear through unforgettable tracks like &quot;My Dark Place Alone,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Death Valley Superstars,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Summertime Suicide&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Drug Me To Hell,&amp;rdquo; to name a few. Even though Joey&apos;s live role in Murderdolls is axe-slinging, his one-of-a-kind drumming fuels the album. Produced by Zeuss [Hatebreed, Shadows Fall] &lt;em&gt;Women and Children Last&lt;/em&gt; exists in an evil little place tucked somewhere in a back alley behind the thrash, glam, punk and arena rock super highways, and Murderdolls have arrived to rip pop culture a new one. All you can do is sing along while they haul off your daughter&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murderdolls began festering within the collective hard rock consciousness in 2002 when they dropped their debut, &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&lt;/em&gt;. A sensation with fans and critics &amp;ndash;Allmusic said &amp;ldquo;Call it gutter-punk, glam rock, or hair metal, every style is displayed here in its despondent glory&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash; the album debuted at #1 on Billboard&amp;rsquo;s Heatseekers chart, despite the fact that the band played a mere 15 shows on U.S. soil.&amp;nbsp; A soundtrack appearance soon followed (&lt;em&gt;Freddy Vs Jason&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Truly an international sensation, &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&lt;/em&gt; achieved Silver status in the U.K., where the band was especially loved: television appearances, magazine covers and sold out shows in 5,000 capacity venues abounded. Burning bright and living up to their out-of-control image, the band toured the world for two years, then took a well-deserved break.&amp;nbsp; Joey returned to the studio and the road for two earth-shattering Slipknot records, &lt;em&gt;Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses&lt;/em&gt; (2004) and &lt;em&gt;All Hope Is Gone&lt;/em&gt; (2008). Meanwhile Wednesday continued to put out solo records independently and to play for his rabid fans all over the globe. While on tour with their respective bands, Joey and Wednesday often fielded the same question from fans: When will the Murderdolls be back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Jordison finished an extensive, 18-month world tour with Slipknot in 2009, there was no better time to revive the beast. He and Wednesday began texting back and forth, quoting &lt;em&gt;Raising Arizona &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Texas Chainsaw Massacre,&lt;/em&gt; and the pair knew the chemistry remained.&amp;nbsp; They began to plot what would become &lt;em&gt;Women and Children Last &lt;/em&gt;and were soon holed up in a Hollywood Hills studio in March 2010, with 25 days to record their second unholy offering. They instantly connected over eight years worth of demos and a flurry of new ideas. It was like no break had ever even occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jordison, who is spending the summer of 2010 touring with Rob Zombie, this album is the start of something very important. &quot;I consider &lt;em&gt;Women and Children Last&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; Murderdolls record,&quot; exclaims the multi-instrumental mastermind. &quot;The music is so much heavier now. Murderdolls haven&apos;t lost the fun, crazy vibe, but the topics are smarter. &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls&lt;/em&gt; was like a sketch and this is the real painting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;To paint this picture with just the right palette of anger and insidiousness, Wednesday dug deep. &amp;nbsp;He declares, &quot;It&apos;s definitely personal. I&apos;ve been doing campy horror lyrics since I was 15-years-old, and I wanted to expand beyond that. For the new Murderdolls, I wanted to keep the humor and violence intact, but I wanted to show a different side of the band. I&apos;m singing about life this time, instead of Dracula. If you really want to get down to it, we&apos;re a sex-drugs-rock-n-roll band more than anything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Drug Me To Hell&quot; and &quot;Blood Stained Valentine&amp;rdquo; feature solos from none other than legendary M&amp;ouml;tley Cr&amp;uuml;e guitarist, Mick Mars. About working with Mars, Jordison states, &quot;He&apos;s always been my favorite member of M&amp;ouml;tley Cr&amp;uuml;e. He&apos;s just a really classy guy, and his guitar playing is so unique. We sent the songs to him, and he loved them. Before we knew it, he was in the studio tracking. The way he plays&amp;mdash;his style&amp;mdash;is so different than anyone that I&apos;ve ever seen. He&apos;s like a demonic Jeff Beck.&quot; Wednesday elaborates, &quot;Every day around 6 o&apos;clock, we&apos;d have dinner and the M&amp;ouml;tley Cr&amp;uuml;e &lt;em&gt;Behind the Music&lt;/em&gt; would be on VH1 Classic. So we had to call Mick for &apos;Blood Stained Valentine.&apos; It was really cool sitting next to this guy in the studio knowing that he wrote some of my favorite songs that were the soundtrack to most of my life. I&apos;ve always considered Mick Mars to be one of the true villains of rock &apos;n&apos; roll like Ozzy and Alice Cooper. I hope one day we&apos;re looked at in that same way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rock &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll&amp;rsquo;s newest villains are here and they&amp;rsquo;re called Murderdolls.</string>

It is an active record.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s how bassist Andrew &amp;ldquo;AJ&amp;rdquo; Jacobs, the sole founding member, effectively encapsulated what Mutiny Within and their self-titled debut are about. The resulting album, &lt;em&gt;Mutiny Within, &lt;/em&gt;is the culmination of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;years of figuring it out, getting it together and finally making it work and it&amp;rsquo;s all manifested in an album that is almost shocking in its technical prowess and its use of melody amid maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs can sum up Mutiny Within&amp;rsquo;s sound as &amp;ldquo;shred with clean vocals, with a little bit of screaming, metal riffs, accessible parts and a lot of melody. We wanted to get all the melody in there. That is the number one thing for us. We want the music to reach metal fans and beyond. We want to reach everyone in between.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these metal upstarts Mutiny Within may have started out as a Children of&amp;nbsp; Bodom cover band &amp;ndash; and they&amp;rsquo;re not embarrassed to admit it since they did grow out of it quickly only to become their own shred-happy entity- the sextet truly stepped on the path to recognition when they started writing their own songs. With origins in the great state of New Jersey, known for producing some of the top, up and coming metal talent in recent years, Mutiny Within also demonstrated their ability to remain ahead of the curve by embracing technology (and we&amp;rsquo;re not talking about the studio trickery kind) and social networking features to take their band to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs formed the band in 2002 and endured a turbulent yet typical early existence until he solidified the lineup. His younger brother Brandon actually plays guitar and was a mere 18-years-old when he recorded the album. Vocalist Chris Clancy was imported from England after the band discovered this talented vox over a YouTube video and now resides in New Jersey. This is a band, who with their self-titled debut, are on the verge of being the valedictorians of the &lt;em&gt;Guitar Hero &lt;/em&gt;generation. They play with astonishing technical skill with a forward-thinking songwriting style that can be viewed as modernly progressive, but definitely not &amp;ldquo;prog.&amp;rdquo; The band&amp;rsquo;s use of keyboards also elevates their sound above and beyond just another up and coming metal band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We were looking for a vocalist and we saw a video of Chris singing, so we contacted him and asked him to try putting vocals over one of our songs,&amp;rdquo; Jacobs recalls. &amp;ldquo;He was the first audition and he rocked it. It was perfect. The only problem was that he lived in England, but he took a risk, flew over and made it work. He lives in my house now.&amp;rdquo; Indeed, Mutiny Within keep things in the family, since the band practices in the basement of drummer Bill Fore, who lives a mere twenty minutes from the Jacobs&amp;rsquo; abode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Clancy committed to making the trek across the pond- he had nothing else to lose as a 23-year-old English kid working at a T-Mobile store- this band of hungry, young turks, who play like a troupe of seasoned, shredding veterans, wrote a whopping 50 songs together, fuelling one another&amp;rsquo;s creativity. The flurry of activity surrounding the band, including their enthrallingly intense live show, captured the attention of Roadrunner Records, which signed the band. After the signing, the band kept writing and eventually went to work with producer Jason Bieler. Clancy&amp;rsquo;s college friend, Dan Bage, eventually joined the band in the middle of recording, which not only makes Mutiny Within an &amp;nbsp;unintentionally &amp;ldquo;international band,&amp;rdquo; but was a situation that invigorated them, too.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Dan was so good that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like we were in the middle of making the record and got a stranger,&amp;rdquo; Jacobs recalled. &amp;ldquo;It was Chris&amp;rsquo; friend and the best guy for the job technically. He flew over, we threw him in the studio, and he did seven solos, wrote four verses and helped rewrite parts, so he is just as important to the band.&amp;rdquo; Clearly, Mutiny Within are a band that can be thrown into the crackling fires of chaotic situations and emerge stronger and more focused than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clancy started singing when he was 15-years-old and consistently worked to hone his craft through noted vocal coach Melissa Cross, so he could truly learn to sing, which only adds to the depth of dynamics on &lt;em&gt;Mutiny Within. &lt;/em&gt;He was not hesitant to abandon his native England in order to pursue his rock &amp;lsquo;n roll and heavy metal dreams, either. Clancy said, &amp;ldquo;I wanted to do this since I was a kid and first started playing in bands. I got myself in a band in Wales and then I dropped my social life there and abandoned my friends to write music and to practice, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t go past the interest stage, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a hard decision to come to America. I quit the job, got on a flight and came over. I spent my life trying to be in a band. That was always my plan, so I told myself if I have to move to do it, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We have all these technical guys who can play so many types of music and have so many different tastes, so for those 50 songs, we went around the world and back,&amp;rdquo; Jacobs says.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, not all 50 songs made the cut, but the sheer numbers demonstrate the band&amp;rsquo;s abilities and range. &amp;ldquo;The 11 songs we picked for the record are our best songs,&amp;rdquo; Jacobs adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band was introduced to the metal world in Fall 2009, via their first national tour with Soulfly, Prong and Cattle Decapitation, in addition to the dozens of local, hometown shows they&amp;rsquo;ve logged and tucked under their belts and will spend much of the year following the release of&lt;em&gt; Mutiny Within &lt;/em&gt;touring and turning heads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opening track &amp;ldquo;Awake&amp;rdquo; is one which defines the band&amp;rsquo;s sound, with Jacobs saying, &amp;ldquo;we get more diverse, with different keys, tempos and styles throughout, but that&amp;rsquo;s the song that defines our sound.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Reflections&amp;rdquo; is another band favorite, thanks to its unforgettable melodies. &amp;nbsp;While Jacobs says that &amp;ldquo;Forsaken&amp;rdquo; is the song where &amp;ldquo;we stepped outside the box to show a different side of the band, with clean guitars.&amp;rdquo;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears as though the Mutiny Within story is just beginning and that the ins and outs of their formation will lead to a happy ending. &amp;ldquo;We dedicated our whole lives to this,&amp;rdquo; Jacobs said. &amp;ldquo;Two guys dropped their lives in England and didn&amp;rsquo;t know if it would work, since we weren&amp;rsquo;t even signed at the time, but we had that dedication to do it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Certainly, Mutiny Within aren&amp;rsquo;t a traditional band, having used technology and the Internet to their benefit and thus forcing the band to work in different ways.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;Most bands get in a van, go out, play, tour, tour, tour,&amp;rdquo; Jacobs said. &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re at that chapter now. The focus for us was always just writing songs. That&amp;rsquo;s been our lives. We played 30 shows with Chris and then got signed. We made every song as special as the next. Each track has lots of time put into it. We were a band that aspired to get a deal and make records, so we made the focus of efforts the songs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mission accomplished on &lt;em&gt;Mutiny Within: &lt;/em&gt;11 songs that usher in a new generation of metal.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

But this is one band that certainly could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since it rolled out of Alberta some 13 years ago, Nickelback has been hit-making, multi-platinum concern whose last album, 2005&apos;s &lt;em&gt;All The Right Reasons &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most successful of the century, and has stoked great expectations for the quartet&apos;s sixth album, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. A lesser group might rest on its proverbial laurels and assume the world is anxiously waiting for it, but Nickelback -- Kroeger, his brother and bassist &lt;strong&gt;Mike Kroeger&lt;/strong&gt;, guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Ryan Peake&lt;/strong&gt; and drummer &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Adair&lt;/strong&gt; -- still feel like a new album is a fresh opportunity to prove themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I honestly think that with every song you release you have to keep winning your own fans over again,&quot; Chad Kroeger explains. &quot;I want every single song to be amazing. That&apos;s what I want to hear, so that&apos;s what we have to try to provide to our fans.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;His brother, bassist Mike Kroeger, adds that, &quot;Any artist that is even surviving right now is a dark horse because things change pretty fast. You&apos;re a superstar one day and wake up the next day and you&apos;re anonymous. To be successful in any way is beating the odds right now, I think.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nickelback is well ahead of those odds, and it continues to pulverize them with &lt;em&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/em&gt;, an 11-track survey of everything the group has done so well to this point -- fist-pumping anthems, grinding rockers, soaring power ballads, grinning sexual innuendo, heart-wringing romanticism, choruses that stick in your ears after the first listen and hooks so big they practically boomerang through the songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Mike Kroeger contends that &lt;em&gt;Dark Horse &lt;/em&gt;&quot;isn&apos;t affecting some huge departure from our past efforts,&quot; it does find the band working in some fresh -- and rarefied -- rock &apos;n&apos; roll territory. It marks the first time Nickelback has worked with an outside producer since &lt;em&gt;Silver Side Up &lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2001, but considering that producer is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, he of AC/DC &quot;Back in Black,&quot; Def Leppard &quot;Pyromania&quot; and &quot;Hysteria&quot; and Foreigner &quot;4&quot; fame, it&apos;s easy to understand why the group was willing to open up the inner sanctum again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was actually somebody we were interested in working with for a long time,&quot; notes Peake. &quot;We had to think a lot about relinquishing a bit of that control to someone else. But we just said, &apos;Yeah, let&apos;s give it a shot.&apos; If there&apos;s anybody we were gonna try to work with, it would be very cool to work with somebody like (Lange), who&apos;s done some pretty fantastic work in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And we knew we&apos;re way too headstrong to let someone else come in and make things totally different for us, no matter who they are!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nickelback&apos;s track record certainly speaks to the group&apos;s stature. The group has sold 27 million albums worldwide and, since the 2001 breakthrough of &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; has sent 13 singles rocketing onto the various Billboard charts, expanding its solid foothold in rock markets to the Top 40 world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All The Right Reasons&lt;/em&gt; insured Nickelback an indelible place in rock history, however. It spent a staggering 112 consecutive weeks in the Top 30 of the Billboard Top 200, was certified 8-times platinum in the U.S. and has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide, topping charts in four countries. &lt;em&gt;All The Right Reasons &lt;/em&gt;spun off seven multi-format singles and made Nickelback the first band in Nielsen BDS history to send five singles onto the CHR charts. All five of the album&apos;s videos hit No. 1 on VH1&apos;s playlist, while Nickelback has sold more than 9 million single digital downloads and more than 5 million ringtones of the album&apos;s songs. &lt;em&gt;All The Right Reasons&lt;/em&gt; won the American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album and helped the quartet to three Billboard Music Awards in 2006 and a pair of Juno Awards in Canada. And on the road, Nickelback has sold more than 1.65 million concert tickets over the course of the album cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It wasn&apos;t like we all sat back and said, &apos;Oh my God, this is gonna be the biggest record of our lives,&apos; &quot; Chad Kroeger recalls. &quot;It was us sitting around saying, &apos;we&apos;re really proud of this record, and I hope that everyone else is gonna love it half as much as we do.&apos; And they did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All The Right Reasons&lt;/em&gt; did, however, set a high bar for &lt;em&gt;Dark Horse&lt;/em&gt;, but the members of Nickelback say they felt a different kind of pressure when they sat down with Lange to start working on the new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That pressure has always been there; it&apos;s self-imposed pressure from before we started selling records,&quot; explains Mike Kroeger. &quot;It&apos;s self-imposed pressure to do your best work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peake adds that, &quot;I&apos;ve been asked quite a bit about the pressure of a new album, and I don&apos;t buy into it. I didn&apos;t buy into it after (2001&apos;s six-times platinum) &lt;em&gt;Silver Side Up,&lt;/em&gt; I didn&apos;t buy into it after (2003&apos;s three-times platinum) &lt;em&gt;Long Road &lt;/em&gt;and I&apos;m not gonna buy into it again. We just have to go in, do the best to our possible abilities and leave it up to the people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on &lt;em&gt;Dark Horse &lt;/em&gt;began in March, after Nickelback made its long-awaited contact with Lange. The band traveled to the producer&apos;s home base in Switzerland to begin going over song ideas. The tunes came from a variety of directions; for instance the dynamically swelling &lt;strong&gt;&quot;If Today Was Your Last Day,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; had been around for awhile but hadn&apos;t been finished. &quot;Chad brought it out of the vault and the creative juices started to flow,&quot; Mike Kroeger notes.&amp;nbsp; Then there&apos;s &quot;&lt;strong&gt;This Afternoon&lt;/strong&gt;,&quot; whose acoustic, rootsy flavor, along with some downright country-style guitar licks represent a refreshing departure from the Nickelback norm. &quot;It&apos;s a big-time part of our background,&quot; Mike Kroeger notes, &quot;that whole laid-back, barroom kind of feel. Where we grew up everybody listened to country. I would say that song&apos;s our &apos;Friends In Low Places,&apos; y&apos;know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Horse&apos;s&lt;/em&gt; other songs -- recorded during the summer at Chad Kroeger&apos;s converted barn studio in Vancouver -- traverse a wide terrain, from the arcing melodic ebb and flow of the first single, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Gotta Be Somebody&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; and the metallic groove of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Burn It To The Ground&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; to the heavy riffery of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Something In Your Mouth&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&quot;The Next Go Round&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and the inspiring balladry of &lt;strong&gt;&quot;You&apos;ll Never Be Alone&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I&apos;d Come For You.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;We&apos;re a rock band,&quot; Peake says. &quot;We like to get heavy and we do like to write stuff that&apos;s melodic and maybe a little more mellow. It&apos;s nice to have both, and it&apos;s nice to have both accepted by the fans. There are some bands that can only put out one kind of thing, but our fans are pretty open so we don&apos;t get stuck in one place.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Kroeger adds that, &quot;I think people expect that level of effort or level of &apos;quality&apos; from us. We don&apos;t pen ourselves into one identity; we&apos;re just trying out new things and doing some things we haven&apos;t done before...and making sure that it&apos;s as good as it can be and the cleanest and most refined version of what we do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s what comes honestly for Nickelback, And it seems to work time and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re kind of a people&apos;s band,&quot; Peake explains, &quot;so we&apos;ll leave it up to them whether they like it or not. We&apos;re one of those bands people come back to, which is very cool.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when it&apos;s applied to a self-declared, multi-platinum dark horse.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                               &lt;p&gt;Equal parts epic metal and gothic symphony, &lt;strong&gt;Nightwish &lt;/strong&gt;stand alone. They blend soaring keyboards and operatic vocals with shredding guitars and jagged rhythms for a style of cinematic, orchestral heavy music all their own.&amp;nbsp; The Finnish quintet has remained a force in the European scene for the last decade, but with their second &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt; release &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Passion Play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, they are destined to captivate metal fans across the entire globe.&amp;nbsp; Filling vocalist Tarja Turunen&amp;#39;s vacant spot with newcomer &lt;strong&gt;Anette Olzon&lt;/strong&gt;, the band is now stronger than ever. They have also crafted a record that&amp;#39;s heavy, hypnotic and downright powerful.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Nightwish&amp;#39;s style has established them as one of the premier female-fronted metal bands. With overpowering keyboard tones reminiscent of classic film scores, the band separates itself. Their combination of seductive, emotional vocals and gallant guitar melodies brings to mind both Evanescence and Iced Earth. Yet, Nightwish have crafted a distinct sound. Their 1997 debut &lt;em&gt;Angels Fall Fast&lt;/em&gt; introduced the world to this sound, propelled by the strength of the single &amp;quot;The Carpenter.&amp;quot; The follow-up &lt;em&gt;Oceanborn&lt;/em&gt; would secure a spot in the Finnish Top Five and spawn three chart-topping singles.&amp;nbsp; In 2000, &lt;em&gt;Wishmaster &lt;/em&gt;cemented the band&amp;#39;s rabid fan following and led to their first U.S. distribution. However, a hard-hitting fourth offering &lt;em&gt;Century Child&lt;/em&gt; added bassist and backing vocalist &lt;strong&gt;Marco Hietela&lt;/strong&gt; to the fold, and it yielded some of the band&amp;#39;s heaviest and darkest tracks up to that point. Nightwish embraced their metallic and classical influences to the fullest and completely established themselves.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;In 2004, the band&amp;#39;s first Roadrunner Records release and fifth studio effort &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;would gain them a foothold in the U.S.&amp;nbsp; They launched a hotly-anticipated tour in The States, packing sold-out theaters across the country. Over the course of the year, &lt;em&gt;Once &lt;/em&gt;surpassed sales of one million units worldwide.&amp;nbsp; The album featured the single &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Nemo,&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; with an entrancing video courtesy of director &lt;strong&gt;Antti Jokinen&lt;/strong&gt; (Eminem). &lt;em&gt;Once &lt;/em&gt;eventually garnered the band five awards at the &lt;strong&gt;Finnish Grammy Awards&lt;/strong&gt; including both &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Band of the Year&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The Best Selling Album of the Year.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; These accolades would solidify Nightwish as an international force.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;After a highly successful world tour in 2005, the band underwent a drastic lineup change. They severed ties with Tarja via an open letter. Fans and the media clamored for a replacement, and questions ran rampant. Though most artists might not be able to recover from a split like this, Nightwish aren&amp;#39;t most artists. The band would check out over 2,000 applications from singers worldwide until they found Anette Olzon. Upon her first visit to Finland, Anette met the band and immediately clicked with them. They announced her addition shortly after. The sexy Swedish singer elevates Nightwish to the next level with a dynamic voice that breathes charisma and life into the new songs. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;Even with the absence of Tarja, Nightwish has crafted an epic, infectious and potent sixth release in the form of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Passion Play&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Tuomas Holopainen&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; keys create huge melodies that are deep, gothic and sensual, while &lt;strong&gt;Emppu Vuorinen&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; guitars hit with an urgent crunch. The record represents the culmination of the band&amp;#39;s evolution and success. It&amp;#39;s a dark, yet infectious journey, featuring all of the elements that fans love about Nightwish-from the symphonic keyboards to the divine melodies. At the forefront of the new music is Anette.&amp;nbsp; Her voice hypnotizes with a diverse range, complementing both the metallic guitars and orchestral keys perfectly. The new songs are some of Nightwish&amp;#39;s most adventurous and powerful. Leadoff single &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Bye Bye Beautiful&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; starts with a precise, calculated riff locked in with warm electronic keys. Then the song launches into vibrant vocal interplay between Anette and Marco with an incendiary and catchy chorus. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;7 Days to the Wolves&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; features galloping guitars with swirling orchestrations and visual lyrics that captivate.&amp;nbsp; On &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Master Passion Greed,&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; epic riffs and keyboards create an inviting, yet intense embrace.&amp;nbsp; Heavy guitars crescendo into an incredible vocal explosion.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Amaranth&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; has a power metal rhythm that builds with a serious urgency. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, Nightwish have further experimented, embracing their new singer&amp;#39;s immense talent and venturing beyond the norm. &amp;quot;Eva&amp;quot; highlights Anette&amp;#39;s versatility, allowing her voice to take center stage and simply soar. The ballad showcases ethereal keyboards and a hauntingly gorgeous chorus. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Nightwish have made a career out of breaking the rules.&amp;nbsp; Their sound could never simply be categorized, and they have managed to continually evolve with each album. With their first U.S. tour with Anette this fall and &lt;em&gt;Dark Passion Play&lt;/em&gt; out October 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, Nightwish are bound to secure their spot at the top.&lt;/p&gt;    </string>

     <string>                             &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; exist in a genre of one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The forward-thinking Swedish titans, who seamlessly and fluidly combine metal, rock, prog, folk and free form jazz, continue the time-honored &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; tradition on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; their second album for &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt;. With this, their ninth effort, &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; continue to shake things up, turn the corner and push the limits of their sound. And the results are breathtaking. Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;sounds at once completely like and absolutely nothing like previous &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; records.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;takes all that is &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt;, and goes where &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; have never gone before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Vocalist/guitarist Mikael &amp;Aring;kerfeldt says, &quot;This record doesn&apos;t sound like a tired band grasping to the last straw. It sounds like a band that is eager to experiment, and that still finds writing music interesting. We&apos;re not just putting out a record to put out a record. This is very much an artistic statement.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;picks up where 2005&apos;s flawless &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Reveries&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;left off, beginning contemplatively before erupting into full-bore chaos. It&apos;s an album that combines brute, blunt&lt;br&gt;force with whimsical, melodic beauty. This is something that wasn&apos;t done intentionally, &amp;Aring;kerfeldt insists. &quot;I try not to be too hung up on having an equal share of screams and singing. I choose the vocal style according to what best fits the song. Some parts have longer instrumental passages as well. Others have quieter vocals. I want what is good for the song, and if that means less death metal vocals or less regular vocals, so be it.&quot; Instead, there are several well-placed screams, which only serve to hammer the points home further. &quot;I&apos;m not wasting time or space,&quot; finishes &amp;Aring;kerfeldt. &quot;The screams on the album matter, because there are less of them. Instead of using long screams to cover up something, I want to deliver lyrics with full passion, which I never spent time doing before.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; An avid obscure rock fan and record collector who buys records daily, &amp;Aring;kerfeldt was inspired and influenced by surprising sources on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve been listening to &amp;lsquo;60s music and psychedelic music,&quot; he reveals. &quot;Like The Zombies&apos; &lt;em&gt;Oddessey &amp;amp; Oracle. &lt;/em&gt;When I heard it, I knew it was one of the best [albums] I have ever heard in my life and I only heard it last year! I listen to other psychedelic music with sound effects. I also listen to Bill Withers and lots of AC/DC and Scott Walker, who is an American crooner. He&apos;s not as slick as Frank Sinatra. He makes very mellow music that is also very dark. His album &lt;em&gt;The Drift &lt;/em&gt;is the darkest record I have ever heard in my life, where he is crooning over layers of disharmonic noise that comes from an orchestra. He was beating on a piece of flesh or meat in the studio, and it gave the song this very avant-garde effect. I wanted to do a metal version of that for our record, a record that was impossible to penetrate.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watershed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; aren&apos;t afraid to think outside of the box, but the album isn&apos;t too much of a departure for &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt;. The signature &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; sound -&amp;Aring;kerfeldt&apos;s haunting vocals and distinct riffing- is in tact. It&apos;s just tighter. &quot;I think it was Leonard Cohen who said, &amp;lsquo;The longer you are a musician, the more you learn and the better you write.&apos; I believe that. I am not one of those guys who can relate to a spontaneous recording by young people full of hormones. I want a delicate, carefully crafted piece of art.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;Aring;kerfeldt continues, saying that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watershed &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;represents the &quot;natural evolution of &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt;. Every now and then, we do make a record that is different, but still us. We did it with &lt;em&gt;My Arms, Your Hearse&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blackwater Park&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Damnation&lt;/em&gt;. Now we are moving forward, and it&apos;s exciting.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; continue to stay fresh and to make relevant music deep into their career. The band is bolstered by the addition of some new membership. Drummer Martin Axenrot plays like a battering ram on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which also introduces new guitarist Fredrik &amp;Aring;kesson, formerly of Arch Enemy, to the fold. &amp;Aring;kerfeldt is rejuvenated, rather than stressed by the lineup shift, saying, &quot;I want the band to be bigger than its lineup. I used to be devastated with line up changes. But people change and that just happens, and I refuse to let &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; be a victim of line up changes. I&apos;ve always been a nostalgic person and I&apos;ve always believed in a stable line-up, but it&apos;s impossible to foresee what&apos;s going to happen. My dreams of a stable line-up died when our first drummer Anders Nordin left in 1997. I think we moved on to better things since his departure and with that, I learned that as long as all members are pulling towards the same goal and are dedicated people who love to play music, we&apos;re set.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One listen to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;proves the band is positively affected by the internal changes. &amp;Aring;kerfeldt claims that &amp;Aring;kesson&apos;s level of skill helps makes &amp;Aring;kerfeldt himself a better player, saying, &quot;I once saw him playing Judas Priest, AC/DC, &lt;strong&gt;King Diamond&lt;/strong&gt; and Metallica covers in a pub, and I was blown away. When he was in Arch Enemy, we did tours together and became friends.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Musically, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is about having good songs and reaching beyond the obvious influences. Atypical form and structure are the norm in &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt;&apos;s universe, but at the end of the day, the band understands that everything comes down to having good songs and ideas. &quot;I like adventurous songs with lots of stuff going on. To be a good metal band, it&apos;s important, if not absolutely necessary, to look beyond metal for influences. If you don&apos;t, you will be a boring, second rate copy of the song you listen to by Iron Maiden,&quot; &amp;Aring;kerfeldt]says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was recorded in the band&apos;s native Sweden and was produced by &amp;Aring;kerfeldt and Jens Bogren. It was the first time &amp;Aring;kerfeldt actually enjoyed the recording process, admitting, &quot;We&apos;re used to the studio environment, so the recording process is not new or thrilling anymore. The biggest change was letting go of my control need. We were recording in two studios, and I couldn&apos;t be at two places at once, so it was stressful, not knowing what was happening at the other studio. But I had to trust the other guys in the band.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watershed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; opens with the quiet, yet powerful &quot;Coil,&quot; which features the bewitching vocals of local folk singer Nathalie Lorichs. &quot;Heir Apparent&quot; is a metallic blockbuster, and the only song with death metal vocals throughout. &quot;The Lotus Eater&quot; features what feels like a first: cleanly sung vocals placed over blast beats! &amp;Aring;kerfeldt is particularly proud of the song saying, &quot;It perfectly represents where my musical head is at the moment. It&apos;s the most fucked up song on the record, which says a lot about me, but that is what I want &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; to sound like today. It&apos;s twisted, complex, and plays through smoothly without interference, despite having a ton of parts.&quot; Smack dab in the middle of the chaos is the gorgeous ballad &quot;Burden&quot; which will remind listeners of bands like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin.  &quot;I wanted to do a big ass mid 70s sounding ballad,&quot; says &amp;Aring;kerfeldt. &quot;I was influenced by The Scorpions. I was listening to &lt;em&gt;In Trance, &lt;/em&gt;and the song, &quot;Living and Dying.&apos; I thought, &amp;lsquo;Wow, I should do a song like this.&apos; It has those mid-70s professional, big solos.&quot; The song &quot;Porcelain Heart&quot; is quite epic, due to the quiet-loud dynamic structure of the song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is the album that will satiate the appetites of &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; diehards, those who have followed the band on their musical journey. It&apos;s also the album that will turn new heads, of those who appreciate both the band&apos;s and the record&apos;s musicality and musicianship. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watershed&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;proves that &lt;strong&gt;Opeth&lt;/strong&gt; are peerless, and truly exist in a genre of one. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</string>

     <string>                             You&amp;rsquo;d be forgiven for mistaking &lt;strong&gt;The Parlor Mob&lt;/strong&gt; for a much older, more gristled outfit. But along with their technical prowess and world-wearied outlook, the Central Jersey quintet has a significant tell &amp;ndash; the careful optimism and sheer energy of the young.  &lt;strong&gt;The Parlor Mob&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s debut album &lt;em&gt;And You Were A Crow&lt;/em&gt; bears all the noise and lessons of the past several years for the band. It&amp;rsquo;s a record constructed out of the most raw materials; the grit and transience of rented apartments and borrowed garages, major label hardship, and the fierce brotherhood that has kept the band together through it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally, however, the hardships the band has suffered appear to be paying off. In addition to the brilliant debut the band has to show for their years together, they&amp;rsquo;ve embarked on their first headlining tour, after consistently selling out rooms in their native New Jersey and New York. &amp;ldquo;Headlining is such a different animal,&amp;rdquo; explains bassist Nick Villapiano. &amp;ldquo;We&apos;re so used to having thirty or forty minutes to try and grab new fans. Now we have a nice time slot to get thoroughly into our songs.&amp;rdquo; But new fans haven&amp;rsquo;t been difficult for the rock outfit to come by lately -- iTunes just named them Best New Artist of 2008 in the rock genre, and since last year&amp;rsquo;s Lollapalooza performance, the band has steadily been growing their already significant fanbase. &amp;ldquo;It was amazing,&amp;rdquo; says guitarist Paul Ritchie of their performance at last year&amp;rsquo;s festival. &amp;ldquo;It was the highlight of all of our careers, I&amp;rsquo;d have to say.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Until now that is. Just before embarking on their TK-date tour, the band wrapped the video for first single &amp;ldquo;Hard Times,&amp;rdquo; a chugging, guitar-driven song that rips the album open with lead singer Mark Melicia&amp;rsquo;s signature moan. More swagger than self-pity, the band decided to showcase what they do best in the video. &amp;ldquo;[It]&amp;rsquo;s performance-based,&amp;rdquo; says guitarist Paul Ritchie. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to showcase our strength, which is performing. We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a cheesy storyline to go along with it.&amp;rdquo; But the band&amp;rsquo;s distaste for cheesiness doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean they&amp;rsquo;re short on sentiment. The song, a prescient political take on the state affairs, is more swagger than self-pity, and its universality is undeniable. Rarely has a generation&amp;rsquo;s problems been put so succinctly, and so head-noddingly, into song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All the setbacks the band sustained to make &lt;em&gt;And You Were A Crow&lt;/em&gt; proved necessary to making the album. After an initial major label deal fell through, the band threw themselves into their work. &amp;ldquo;We have a basic gameplan,&amp;rdquo; Villapiano continues. &amp;ldquo;We perpetually write. More than anything, it&amp;rsquo;s a way of therapy, a way to keep us on track.&amp;rdquo; Where a lesser band may have retreated to day jobs and eventual nostalgia, &lt;strong&gt;The Parlor Mob&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; named for a group of 19th century mercenaries used in New York City riots &amp;ndash; channeled their misfortune into their art. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Showcasing the depth of their influences, the band offers up twelve varied tracks with &lt;em&gt;And You Were A Crow&lt;/em&gt;, each plumbing one of the many emotions brought on by the events of the band&amp;rsquo;s five-year history. The epic, emotive &amp;ldquo;Tide of Tears&amp;rdquo; makes use of Melicia&amp;rsquo;s heart-rending scream amidst dredging guitars and a buoying piano, while elsewhere his smooth croon laces acoustic shuffler &amp;ldquo;Angry Young Girl.&amp;rdquo; The soulful sway of &amp;ldquo;When I Was An Orphan,&amp;rdquo; says guitarist Dave Rosen, is an expansion of the band&amp;rsquo;s sound. &amp;ldquo;To me, it&amp;rsquo;s darker and bigger and heavier. [These songs] don&amp;rsquo;t sound like a band that&amp;rsquo;s trying to find itself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Recorded in Echo Mountain Recording Studios in Asheville, North Carolina, the band worked with producer Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Modest Mouse), who sought out the band&amp;rsquo;s new record company to work with them. &amp;ldquo;What sold us on him was his desire to do the majority of the record based on our live performance in the studio. And that&amp;rsquo;s basically what it is,&amp;rdquo; says Ritchie.&amp;nbsp; King, infused the album with the camaraderie the band has in abundance. On &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t Keep No Good Boy Down,&amp;rdquo; King suggested the band give some indication of the time they were having. &amp;ldquo;We wanted to get a little ambient stuff going on &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a redemptive song, so have some chatter and indication that we were having a good time. So we mic&amp;rsquo;ed the live room where we were recording, brought up some cases of beers and tequila, and recorded the room and talk,&amp;rdquo; says Villapiano.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The moods evoked through the symbiosis of music and lyrics make &lt;em&gt;And You Were A Crow&lt;/em&gt; a visceral journey, at times deep and dark, and at times thrashing good fun. It&amp;rsquo;s a time capsule of the lives of five individuals, of place and time. Above all, it&amp;rsquo;s a testament to the redemptive power of rock and roll for this generation. &amp;ldquo;Our story and our outlook are pretty self-explanatory,&amp;rdquo; says Villapiano. &amp;ldquo;Just a bunch of friends who really love music, really love each other, and are trying our best to share what we&amp;rsquo;ve got with as many people as we can.&amp;rdquo;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Porcupine Tree is unquestionably one of the most difficult-to-categorize and innovative bands working today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band is fronted by Steven Wilson, who also is well-known for his work producing other artists, from Swedish progressive metal group Opeth, to Norwegian chanteuse Anja Garbarek. He also has several other projects, including No-Man, Bass Communion, and Blackfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porcupine Tree was founded as a self-indulgent creative outlet for Wilson, and the first major release was &amp;lsquo;On the Sunday of Life...&amp;rsquo; in 1992, an album of psychedelia and studio experiments which bears little relation to the band&apos;s current sound. From here, Wilson expanded the sound, creating the progressive rock/ambient trance fusion on the 30-minute long single &amp;ldquo;Voyage 34.&amp;rdquo; One of the only constants in Porcupine Tree&amp;rsquo;s music is how it continues to evolve and confront the expectations of the band&apos;s fans from album to album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 1993, the solo project became a band, as Colin Edwin (bass), Chris Maitland (drums), and Richard Barbieri (keyboards) were recruited to enable Porcupine Tree to perform live. Richard had previously been a member of one of the most experimental 80&apos;s bands, Japan. The first real band album recorded was &amp;lsquo;Signify&amp;rsquo; in 1996, which was followed by &amp;lsquo;Stupid Dream&amp;rsquo; (1999), a breakthrough album which saw the band move into a more song-orientated direction. &amp;lsquo;Lightbulb Sun&amp;rsquo; continued along that song-oriented tack, but, never content to rest on their laurels, Porcupine Tree changed course again for their next release, shuffling their lineup for the first (and to date, only) time. Chris Maitland departed and was replaced by Gavin Harrison in 2002, as the band signed a new international recording deal with Lava/Atlantic Records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, three major label album releases -- &amp;lsquo;In Absentia&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Deadwing, and the Grammy-nominated &amp;ldquo;Fear of a Blank Planet&amp;rsquo; -- have augmented the band&apos;s renown. Heavier than previous releases, the albums have found favor with older fans and introduced Porcupine Tree to a whole new audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Porcupine Tree moved to the highly successful independent rock label Roadrunner for Europe. Since releasing Fear of a Blank Planet in 2006, the band have also released a number of titles on its own Transmission label, including the EP Nil Recurring, and the acoustic album We Lost the Skyline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; is Porcupine Tree&amp;rsquo;s tenth studio album and like &amp;lsquo;Fear Of A Blank Planet&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; which was an elaborate conceptual piece fuelled by a 21st century cocktail of MTV, sex, prescription drugs, video games, the internet, terminal boredom and subsequent escape &amp;ndash; it takes the listener on a thrilling audio journey. In turns haunting, desolate, hypnotic and euphoric, its centre-piece is the title track &amp;ndash; a stunning 55-minute musical statement that breaks down into 14 separate and often diverse (though interlinked) vignettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tale begins slowly with &amp;lsquo;Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor&amp;rsquo;, gaining momentum and intensity with &amp;lsquo;The Blind House,&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Drawing The Line&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; itself, though the group&amp;rsquo;s masterful manipulation of sounds and textures is never overlooked. The mellowness of &amp;lsquo;The Yellow Windows Of The Evening Train,&amp;rsquo; for instance, is accompanied by the gentle crackle of a needle on vinyl &amp;ndash; for all his skill as a producer and remixer, Wilson is a staunch supporter of the &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; ways of listening to music. Incorporating both of these styles, &amp;lsquo;Octane Twisted&amp;rsquo; somehow batters and seduces simultaneously, while &amp;lsquo;I Drive The Hearse,&amp;rsquo; further sweetened by an uplifting guitar climax, is an intoxicating slice of melancholy with which to book-end the record&amp;rsquo;s 14-piece song cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds of the idea that led to &amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; came to Steven Wilson as he became caught up in a motorway traffic jam whilst driving past a road accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There was a sign saying &amp;lsquo;POLICE &amp;ndash; INCIDENT&amp;rsquo; and everyone was slowing down to rubber neck what had happened,&amp;rdquo; he recalls. &amp;ldquo;Afterwards, it struck me that &amp;lsquo;incident&amp;rsquo; is a very detached word for something so destructive and traumatic for the people involved. And then I had the sensation that the spirit of someone that had died in the car accident entered into my car and was sitting next to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The irony of such a cold expression for such seismic events appealed to me, and I began to pick out other &amp;lsquo;incidents&amp;rsquo; reported in the media and news,&amp;rdquo; continues Wilson. &amp;ldquo;I wrote about the evacuation of teenage girls from a religious cult in Texas, a family terrorizing its neighbours, a body found floating in a river by some people on a fishing trip, and more. Each song was written in the first person and tried to humanize the detached media reportage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Wilson delved back into incidents in his own life that had profound affected him, including a lost childhood friendship, a s&amp;eacute;ance, his first love, and the day that he decided to give up secure employment to follow his dream of making music. The album&amp;rsquo;s epic song, an 11-minute Pink Floyd-flavoured masterpiece called &amp;lsquo;Time Flies&amp;rsquo;, for instance, begins with the line: &amp;ldquo;I was born in 1967.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;1967 was possibly the most significant year in the history of rock music; &amp;lsquo;Sergeant Pepper&amp;rsquo; by the Beatles and the first albums by Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and The Doors were all released that year,&amp;rdquo; says Steven. &amp;ldquo;I found myself wondering whether those facts were significant&amp;hellip; maybe it&amp;rsquo;s why I ended up becoming a musician?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; poses a lot of important questions and will give the listener plenty of food for thought. As ever, though, Wilson is loath to provide what he thinks the answers might be. &amp;ldquo;One of the beauties of music &amp;ndash; one of the reasons it&amp;rsquo;s still the greatest art-form, even over cinema &amp;ndash; is that it demands so much of the person that experiences it, as well as those that create it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; is certainly not the kind of album that will be fully absorbed in a single sitting. Indeed, repeated listenings reveal all sorts of hidden detail. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not an album that should inspire a passive response,&amp;rdquo; proclaims Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pushed for a more succinct description he calls &amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo;: &amp;ldquo;A slightly surreal song cycle about beginnings and endings and the sense that &amp;lsquo;after this, things will never be the same again&amp;rsquo;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to the recording sessions following his first ever solo album, November 2008&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Insurgentes,&amp;rsquo; Wilson admits that the experience of having worked alone affected the direction of &amp;lsquo;The Incident.&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;Possibly because of having done that, this record is darker, more expansive, and more experimental,&amp;rdquo; he theorizes. &amp;ldquo;But when I write for Porcupine Tree, I know the sound I&amp;rsquo;m after.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;Fear Of A Blank Planet&amp;rsquo; featured contributions from three special guests &amp;ndash; Alex Lifeson of Rush, King Crimson&amp;rsquo;s Robert Fripp and the band&amp;rsquo;s live guitarist John Wesley &amp;ndash; and &amp;lsquo;Insurgentes&amp;rsquo; was also executed with considerable outside help, &amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; is slightly unusual for being completely self-contained. Like its predecessor, however, it was self-produced by all four group members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; is completed by four standalone compositions &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;Flicker&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Bonnie The Cat&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Black Dahlia&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Remember Me Love&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; all housed on a separate CD to stress their independence from the record&amp;rsquo;s main 14-part suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with &amp;lsquo;Fear Of A Blank Planet&amp;rsquo;, the Wilson-helmed 5.1 mix of which was nominated in the Best Surround Album Award at the 2007 Grammies (eventually losing out to The Beatles&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Love&amp;rsquo;), Porcupine Tree will be performing &amp;lsquo;The Incident&amp;rsquo; in its entirety during the first shows of its next world tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porcupine Tree is Steven Wilson, Colin Edwin, Richard Barbieri, and Gavin Harrison.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;It happens all the time. Popular bands break up, then years later they reunite and sadly wind up sounding little like the turbo-fueled entities they once were when they started. Then there are the rare exceptions &amp;ndash; like &lt;strong&gt;Ratt&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the story goes, Ratt helped pioneer Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s legendary Sunset Strip sound and scene.&amp;nbsp; The band has returned sounding fired up and better than ever. Ratt&amp;rsquo;s first studio album in 11 years, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, is a return to their heavy, riff driven roots.&amp;nbsp; The band has reinvented their sound by rediscovering their strengths, shuttling listeners to a time when metal ruled the earth and real musicians wore eyeliner like a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We wanted this to be like something that we would have written right after [1984&amp;rsquo;s] &lt;em&gt;Out of the Cellar&lt;/em&gt;, says vocalist &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Pearcy&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;ldquo;We definitely went back to basics with the mindset of a band with a lot of excitement and some great songs to get out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right out of the box, &lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt; ignites like gasoline to an open flame, bursting with an energy and attitude absent from metal for years, unheard, perhaps, since before the dawn of DVDs, grunge and Facebook. Album opener &amp;ldquo;Eat Me Up Alive&amp;rdquo; slaps you in the face with attitude and a timeless riff that has been a staple in Ratt&amp;rsquo;s music and has set them apart from the pack.&amp;nbsp; From the strip pole gyrations of &amp;ldquo;Look Out Below&amp;rdquo; to the keg party anthem &amp;ldquo;Take a Big Bite,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt; rages with a life and energy that Ratt is famous for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt; is more than a party album. While the music is a glorious celebration throughout, some of the lyrics are serious and sobering, weighing the benefits of monogamy versus the thrill of rampant hedonism without being preachy or judgmental. On &amp;ldquo;Take Me Home,&amp;rdquo; Pearcy declares, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you a little secret that you need to know/ you&amp;rsquo;re always in my heart, always in my soul.&amp;rdquo; Then, in &amp;ldquo;Garden of Eden,&amp;rdquo; his alter ego brags: &amp;ldquo;I got a bad reputation and you knew it so well/ yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you what you need/I&amp;rsquo;m gonna take you to hell.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was not in that good of a place emotionally when we were writing this record,&amp;rdquo; admits Pearcy. &amp;ldquo;Sure there are sexual innuendos and party stuff, but there are also songs that deal with some very real issues. The lyrics meant so much to me that every morning for weeks prior to recording, I would wake up and rewrite. It was a strange process for me, but it worked.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratt started writing &lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt; in January 2009, and by April they had 20 new songs, which they refined with producer &lt;strong&gt;Michael &amp;ldquo;Elvis&amp;rdquo; Baskette&lt;/strong&gt; (Chevelle, Alter Bridge). But before they could even start the shiny metal wheels rolling, they had to secure their lineup and repair years of enmity that developed when Pearcy abruptly quit for personal reasons in 1999. It was a rough era for Ratt. Pearcy was replaced by vocalist Jizzy Pearl and John Corabi took the second guitar slot, replacing original axeman Robbin Crosby.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founding drummer&lt;strong&gt; Bobby Blotzer&lt;/strong&gt; and bassist &lt;strong&gt;Robbie Crane&lt;/strong&gt;, who has been a mainstay and driving force in the band since 1996, remained constant, though while Ratt worked hard in the early &amp;lsquo;90s, they purposely stayed on the road and out of the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We decided not to pursue recording a Ratt record when Stephen was out of the band&lt;em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; &lt;/em&gt;says guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Warren DeMartini&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;ldquo;We definitely wanted to retain that same lineup for a long time, but life comes along and changes those plans. Stephen quit the band, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t want that to mean the end of Ratt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some serious discussions, Pearcy rejoined and in 2007, DeMartini, Pearcy, Blotzer and Crane took the stage together for the first time in eight years, playing over 50 dates&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and releasing the best of CD &lt;em&gt;Tell the World: The Very Best of Ratt&lt;/em&gt;. Also, they released their first ever DVD &lt;em&gt;RATT Videos from the Cellar: The Atlantic Years&lt;/em&gt;. The shows were a telling precursor of what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That &lt;em&gt;tour&lt;/em&gt; was really exciting and refreshing because the sound was back, and even better,&amp;rdquo; DeMartini says. &amp;ldquo;Stephen had grown, we had grown, and with those pieces restored, we knew we could get back to writing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a bunch of shows under their belts, Ratt were eager to get back into the cellar and write some new songs, but they wanted to add to their lineup. DeMartini suggested ex-Quiet Riot guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Carlos Cavazo&lt;/strong&gt; to round out the lineup. Cavazo, a well known, accomplished lead player gives Ratt the twin-guitar attack and credibility they had in the early days with Crosby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I thought of bringing in Carlos a couple years before it actually happened,&amp;rdquo; DeMartini says. &amp;ldquo;At the time, we thought we were going to be replacing John because of conflicting schedules and I started thinking it would be cool to have Carlos. So when the time was right, he was the first person I called.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cavazo, who was between projects the offer came at a perfect time. And since he already knew the guys in Ratt from the early days, he felt comfortable with the personalities of the players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It worked out great for me and felt very natural,&amp;rdquo; Cavazo says. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s funny because I was just hanging out in my house one day and I missed a call. So I checked my voice mail and noticed it was Warren. The first thing I&amp;rsquo;m thinking is, &amp;lsquo;Either there&amp;rsquo;s a big party he&amp;rsquo;s going to invite me to somewhere, or they&amp;rsquo;re looking for a new guitar player.&amp;rsquo; Obviously, it was the latter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s great to be able to do the more exotic double lead stuff that I&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;did back in the day with Robbin,&amp;rdquo; DeMartini says. &amp;ldquo;I wanted someone I could collaborate with and someone who could sing well, so Carlos worked out on all levels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratt flew to a remote area of Virginia Beach in spring 2009 to work on new songs. They stayed in a four bedroom house there and wrote on their own schedule, banging out riff after riff and molding them into tunes quickly and with great enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We wanted go off the beaten path on this one and set up somewhere we could eat, sleep and create the album in the same place,&amp;rdquo; DeMartini says. &amp;ldquo;It was great fun; we had the camaraderie of a road trip together with the environment to really stay focused.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While DeMartini, Cavazo, Crane and drummer Bobby Blotzer finessed the music, Pearcy stayed in his room and worked on his lyrics&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was exciting because none of us knew how the melody and the lyrics would work with the songs until Stephen finally brought us his part,&amp;rdquo; Blotzer says. &amp;ldquo;The outcome was surprising in a good way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was great that we had those writing sessions together,&amp;rdquo; Pearcy adds. &amp;ldquo;Some of my parts were written right then and there in the studio in preproduction. That hadn&amp;rsquo;t happened since &amp;lsquo;83 and &amp;lsquo;84. One of these songs, &amp;ldquo;Garden of Eden,&amp;rdquo; was just a riff idea, but then in preproduction Warren just started playing this riff and I went, &amp;lsquo;What is that? I like it. Keep that. Work on that.&amp;rsquo; And we worked it out that day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ratt worked out their ideas in preproduction, Baskette recorded their jam session on two-inch analog tape, much of the same equipment the band had used in the &amp;lsquo;80s. In addition, he employed numerous modern studio techniques to capture the sound the band was after. Baskette also helped Ratt hone good ideas into great songs and gave the musicians the liberty to let fly with whatever creative ideas they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was very focused on playing harder and more outside the constraints that I had on previous Ratt records,&amp;rdquo; Blotzer says. &amp;ldquo;And I was really given the key to do that from the band and from Elvis.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It was great for Carlos and me as well because Elvis was a guitarist in a band before he was a producer, and he&amp;rsquo;s real into tones,&amp;rdquo; DeMartini says. &amp;ldquo;He was coming from the same place guitar-wise as us&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative playing, recording and circumstantial synergy shines throughout &lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt;. The first single &amp;ldquo;Best of Me&amp;rdquo; is a feast of foot-to-the floor dynamics that features gritty vocals that uncurl like a coiled snake into a glorious chorus, and guitar lines as memorable as a dirty limerick. &amp;ldquo;Garden of Eden&amp;rdquo; builds from a bluesy intro into a pounding gallop, and shifts into a surging stop-start sky-puncher at the midpoint. But maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a line in the mid-paced &amp;ldquo;As Good as it Gets&amp;rdquo; that most accurately sums up the approach, attitude and conviction of &lt;em&gt;Infestation&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;You get just what you came for.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our music is like it was in the beginning; it means everything to us,&amp;rdquo; Pearcy says. &amp;ldquo;And here we are 25 years later, keeping Ratt N&amp;rsquo; Roll alive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When we play concerts now, there&amp;rsquo;s a new generation.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;rsquo;re seeing kids of people who grew up with us, but the reaction is the same,&amp;rdquo; adds DeMartini. &amp;ldquo;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to matter where we are in the world.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt; are delighted to announce the signing of boisterous Welsh metal quartet &lt;strong&gt;REVOKER&lt;/strong&gt;. Hailing from the depths of Wales&apos; Rhymney Valley, the band will soon start work on their debut album with &lt;strong&gt;Skindred&lt;/strong&gt;&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;Benji Webbe&lt;/strong&gt; for an early 2011 release. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a vote of confidence in the band&apos;s bright future, look no further than &lt;strong&gt;Monte Conner&lt;/strong&gt;,  Roadrunner&apos;s Senior VP A&amp;amp;R. Conner enthuses, &quot;Revoker are one of  the most ass-kicking unsigned bands I have heard in a long time and I am  beyond proud to welcome them to the Roadrunner family. Believe it or  not, in my entire career at Roadrunner, they are the first UK band I  have signed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;strong&gt;Revoker&lt;/strong&gt; officially formed in Spring 2006, frontman/guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Jamie Mathias&lt;/strong&gt; and guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Chris Green &lt;/strong&gt;have been playing in bands together since they became teenagers. The band&apos;s engaging 19-year old mouthpiece &lt;strong&gt;Mathias &lt;/strong&gt;comments,  &quot;Getting signed to Roadrunner is amazing and almost surreal. I&apos;ve grown  up listening to bands like Megadeth, Slipknot and Machine Head. So to  be a part of the same label as them is nuts! I think Roadrunner is the  perfect home for Revoker!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green &lt;/strong&gt;echoes his thoughts: &quot;It&apos;s mind-blowing!  If I could have picked any label then this would be it. I think this is  the perfect label for us to be joining with. It&apos;s amazing to be part of  such a mammoth roster with bands we&apos;ve looked up to for years  ourselves.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If there&apos;s one label any metal band dream of signing to, it&apos;s Roadrunner!&quot; said bassist &lt;strong&gt;Shane Phillips&lt;/strong&gt; . The group is rounded out by &lt;strong&gt;Jack Pritchard&lt;/strong&gt; on the drums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the UK&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;Hammerfest &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Download Festival &lt;/strong&gt;already under their belt, not to mention praise-inducing support slots with &lt;strong&gt;Skindred &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;Soulfly&lt;/strong&gt;, expect to see a lot more of these formidable youngsters as they take on the world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says &lt;strong&gt;Skindred&lt;/strong&gt;&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;Benji&lt;/strong&gt;, &quot;It was  not just the music that drew me to Revoker - although they blew me away -  it was their attitude of &apos;we got it and we&apos;re going to give it to you  like it or not.&apos; From watching them live for the very first time and  then going on to help them sculpt their songs, I knew it would only take  a push in the right direction to make them explode from their sleepy  Welsh hamlet onto the worldwide metal stage - and now with the help of  Roadrunner they&apos;re about to do just that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             It was a &quot;You had to be there&quot; event. A concert during which 39 musicians, representing 25 different Roadrunner bands, performing 25 songs from 19 different bands&amp;rsquo; repertoire. This unique and unprecedented aggregation of musicians was no jam session. Each song was studiously rehearsed and arranged and came together in exuberant perfection. By the time everything was said and done, it was one helluva a party. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&apos;s time for the DVD that captured it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roadrunner Records&apos; 25th anniversary celebration, held on Thursday, December 15, 2005 at New York City&apos;s Nokia Theater, was a night to remember. For those who experienced the event first hand, it was a once-in-a-lifetime party and concert where artists that spanned the label&apos;s history, as well as artist and industry friends, converged to toast all things Roadrunner. The party was held in conjunction with the landmark &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadrunner United The All-Star Sessions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; album, released two months prior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost three years to the day later, Roadrunner is releasing a DVD that chronicles an evening of raised metal horns, dubbed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadrunner United The Concert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a two-disc set that captures the festive intensity of the night. The concert enjoyed a cult, &quot;You had to be there!&quot; status in the metal and hard rock scenes and now Roadrunner is giving the label&apos;s diehard followers a chance to witness the event themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout its rich and impressive history, Roadrunner Records has been destined for greatness, evolving from a small Dutch licensing label into one of the most innovative record labels in the world. Fiercely independent since its start, Roadrunner has achieved something that many labels seek and never attain, let alone maintain for a quarter-century: brand recognition. The Roadrunner logo has come to mean two things to millions of fans around the world: a high standard of quality in musicianship and presentation and an unwavering commitment to the best, most unique and intense in the hard rock and heavy metal genres. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2005, in typical Roadrunner fashion, the label devised a brilliantly inventive way to celebrate its milestone 25th anniversary. Paying homage to its past, giving a nod to its future and framing both in the most creative terms possible, Roadrunner released an album of original new heavy music, played by some of the genre&apos;s best and most highly-regarded practitioners. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;Roadrunner&apos;s owner, Cees Wessels, asked me to come up with an idea to celebrate Roadrunner&apos;s 25th anniversary,&amp;rdquo; recalls A&amp;amp;R visionary Monte Conner. &amp;ldquo;I knew that for it to be really special, we would need to come up with a record that involved many musicians, one that was truly a collaboration on a grand scale, an album that would cover the entire history of Roadrunner and feature some of our most legendary artists from the past, right up to and including musicians from our newest signings.&amp;rdquo; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea was mathematical from the get-go and was formulated to create four &amp;ldquo;teams&amp;rdquo; -- each headed by a &amp;ldquo;team captain.&amp;rdquo; Each team would consist of a core of musicians who would lay down basic tracks for four original songs written by the team captain. Each song would use a different vocalist, and no player could appear on a tune by another team. The four captains -- &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; drummer Joey Jordison, &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; frontman Robb Flynn, former&lt;strong&gt; Fear Factory&lt;/strong&gt; guitarist Dino Cazares and &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt; vocalist Matthew K. Heafy &amp;ndash; assembled their songs and their musicians for an album that was released in October 2005. An astounding total of 56 musicians from 44 different bands were assembled in an amazing organizational feat and a sign of the respect and that each player had for each other and the label itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, those same artists, and then some, continued to pay their respects to Roadrunner for the &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner United&lt;/strong&gt; concert! Most of the musicians that performed on the album trekked to NYC for the party and performance. Many artists from Roadrunner&apos;s history who weren&apos;t even on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roadrunner United The All-Star Sessions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; album were in attendance. Musicians who were friends of the label also agreed to lend their talents to the performance. The core &quot;house&quot; band consisted of &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&apos;s &lt;/strong&gt;Joey Jordison and Paul Gray, &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Adam Duce, &lt;strong&gt;Sepultura&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Andreas Kisser, &lt;strong&gt;Soulfly&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Stone Sour&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Roy Mayorga, &lt;strong&gt;Fear Factory&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Dino Cazares, who throughout the evening,  were joined by a jaw-dropping, rotating cast of performers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the evening&apos;s highlights included &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Corey Taylor singing while perched atop the shoulders of  &lt;strong&gt;Killswitch Engage&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Howard Jones. Former &lt;strong&gt;Killswitch Engage&lt;/strong&gt; vocalist Jesse Leach reunited with his former band for a rendition of &quot;My Last Serenade.&quot; Other gems included an animated performance by &lt;strong&gt;Shadows Fall&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Brian Fair, a &quot;F** Monte Conner&quot; chant, Taylor performing &quot;Bother&quot; with &lt;strong&gt;Life of Agony&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; Keith Caputo, and Taylor watching Flynn perform one of &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&apos;s&lt;/strong&gt; songs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The double-disc set features the concert footage as well as a second disc, a 75-minute documentary, complete with interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, making the festivities that much more intimate for the viewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the performers were: Steve Asheim, Matt Baumbach, Corey Beaulieu, Glenn Benton, Rob Caggiano, Keith Caputo, Dino Cazares, Mike D&apos;Antonio, Phil Demmel, Adam Duce, Brian Fair, Robb Flynn, Justin Foley, Paul Gray, Billy Graziadei, Paolo Gregoletto, Matthew K. Heafy, Andols Herrick, Scott Ian, Jamey Jasta, Howard Jones, Joey Jordison, Andreas, Kisser, Jesse Leach, Logan Mader, Roy Mayorga, James Murphy, Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, Nadja Puelen, Evan Seinfeld, Acey Slade, Travis Smith, Joel Stroetzel, Corey Taylor, Ville Valo, Tommy Vext, Jeff Waters, Jordan Whelan and Tim Williams.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Indeed, heavy metal history was made on December 15, 2005. Here&apos;s to another 25 years of Roadrunner Records exerting its dominance in the headbanging, hard rocking sphere.</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;A music artist and auteur filmmaker with shrewd insight and unlimited vision, &lt;strong&gt;Rob Zombie&lt;/strong&gt; has continuously challenged audiences as he stretches the boundaries of film, music and publishing. He&amp;rsquo;s not happy merely sporting a single creative hat; instead, he submerges himself fully in each artistic endeavor, rolling up his sleeves and immersing his hands completely in each project. That&amp;rsquo;s the long and short of the artist known as Rob Zombie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the arena in which Rob Zombie is best known and most celebrated for is his music. He is a 7 time Grammy-nominated recording artist, having sold over fifteen million albums worldwide to date. Late 2009 brings Zombie to a new home at &lt;strong&gt;Loud&amp;amp;Proud/Roadrunner Records&lt;/strong&gt;, with a new album, the long awaited &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, due out February 2, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demons were let loose on &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe 2,&lt;/em&gt; which comes a dozen years after its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe, &lt;/em&gt;the album that established Zombie as a solo artist in his own right following the demise of White Zombie. That album also yielded a string of successful radio singles, namely &amp;ldquo;Dragula&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Living Dead Girl,&amp;rdquo; both of which dominated the airwaves in 1998 and 1999, closing out the decade, Zombie style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a new decade (and a new millennium, not to mention) and &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe 2 &lt;/em&gt;picks up where its predecessor left off. Even though there were two studio albums -2001&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;The Sinister Urge&lt;/em&gt; and 2006&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Educated &lt;/em&gt;Horses&amp;mdash;in between the &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly &lt;/em&gt;bookends, only an artist of Zombie&amp;rsquo;s caliber, however, can make the jump so seamlessly with &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe 2, &lt;/em&gt;which features the infectious single, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sick Bubblegum,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; which sounds like it was written during the original&amp;rsquo;s sessions, but remains modern, relevant and forward-thinking. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; is a catchy, distorted track that screams of signature Zombie, the one his throng of fans knows and loves. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Werewolf, Baby!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; is another sick &amp;lsquo;n twisted rock &amp;lsquo;n roll anthem, while other electric romps like &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jesus Frankenstein&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and the thunderous &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mars Needs Women&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; are vintage Zombie featuring ass-moving grooves piled on&amp;nbsp; a storm of chunky riffs. &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; 2 is Rob Zombie in 2010: leaner and meaner, with the same snarl and appreciation for all things dark and a little bit dastardly. It&amp;rsquo;s no easy feat to record a companion-style follow-up 10 years later, but Rob Zombie makes it look and sound easy. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This was one of the least stressful records I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made. The songs fell together in record time. &amp;rdquo; says Zombie, &amp;ldquo;For some reason the best songs always come easy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not content to merely arrest the world with his delightfully nefarious tunes, Rob Zombie directed the second edition of the Halloween franchise,&lt;em&gt; Halloween 2&lt;/em&gt; for Dimension Films, which came out in August 2009. It was his fifth time writing and directing a feature film. Zombie had also interpreted John Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s original cult horror film &lt;em&gt;Halloween &lt;/em&gt;in 2007; that film premiered &amp;nbsp;at number one at the box office, &amp;nbsp;breaking all Labor Day Weekend 2007 records and grossing an estimated 80 million dollars worldwide. His efforts on rebooting and reinventing this beloved franchise earned him two nominations from Spike TV&amp;rsquo;s Scream Awards, for Best Director and Best Remake; he picked up the award for the latter. &amp;nbsp;His previous films include 2004&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;House of 1000 Corpses &lt;/em&gt;and 2005&amp;rsquo;s critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;The Devil&amp;rsquo;s Rejects &lt;/em&gt;also a Spike Award winner&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Zombie wrapped production on his animated, R-rated feature, &lt;em&gt;The Haunted World of El Superbeasto, &lt;/em&gt;which is now available on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past two decades Zombie has directed dozens of videos, having lensed tracks for fellow metal superstar Ozzy Osbourne, among others. He contributes material to soundtracks and isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to push boundaries and ignore the parameters when it comes to the both the audio and visual mediums. He won the 1995 MTV Music Video Award for White Zombie&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;More Human Than Human,&amp;rsquo; making history by becoming the first self-directed artist to pick up the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fall 2009, Zombie kicked off the &amp;lsquo;Hellbilly Deluxe 2 Tour,&amp;rdquo; where he was accompanied by his longtime bandmates: guitarist John 5, bassist Piggy D and drummer Tommy Clufetos.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I am bouncing off the walls like a mental patient,&amp;rdquo; Zombie said about the tour. &amp;ldquo;That tells me it&amp;rsquo;s time to take it to the stage and let the demons loose.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; Zombie will continue to tour following the album&amp;rsquo;s release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to any artistic feat or endeavor, leave it to Rob Zombie to accomplish what appears on paper to be nearly impossible. Armed with &lt;em&gt;Hellbilly Deluxe 2, &lt;/em&gt;this artist is once again about to swoop down and capture the hearts of hard rockers the world over.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; singer Corey Taylor knew his band was destined for greatness. He also knew that it wouldn&apos;t come easy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;When we were starting out, we had all these strikes against us,&quot; he says. &quot;We were from Iowa, there were nine of us, we wore masks, we wore coveralls, we played metal. Hard metal.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It was tough getting people to come out to Des Moines,&quot; adds bassist Paul Gray. &quot;I don&apos;t know why, it&apos;s a pretty cool place. But A&amp;amp;R dudes -- jaded folks from Los Angeles or New York -- it&apos;s hard to get them to come to Iowa.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;And then there were all the haters,&quot; says Taylor.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, the haters. The people who liked nothing more than to give the band flack for its look, for substituting numbers for names, for putting on a show full of over-the-top chaos and unmitigated mayhem. Some of the comments came from the usual assortment of web sites and so-called music critics. But, surprisingly, &quot;we also took a lot of shit from other bands,&quot; says guitarist James Root. &quot;When we hit the road with Ozzfest in 1999, I heard a lot of condescending remarks from other musicians. They were saying, &apos;Slipknot won&apos;t sell enough records, they won&apos;t survive, they&apos;ve got too many people, nobody&apos;s gonna get it, they&apos;re all about image.&apos; &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The joke&apos;s on them,&quot; says Taylor with wicked glee. &quot;Our music stood up. We&apos;re much more popular now and it wasn&apos;t because of our image. It was the music.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Now, most of the bands who turned slagging &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; into an extreme sport have fallen off the face of the earth. The &apos;Knot, on the other hand, have spent nearly a decade cementing their place as one of hard rock&amp;rsquo;s most extreme acts. They&apos;ve dropped three albums and two DVDs, all of which went Platinum or better. They&apos;ve sold out festivals and tours around the globe. And they are preparing to release their fourth record, All Hope Is Gone. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; -- which features DJ Sid Wilson (0), drummer Joey Jordison (1), Gray (2), percussionist Chris Fehn (3) Root (4), sampler Craig Jones - 133 (5), percussionist M. Shawn Crahan - Clown (6), guitarist Mick Thomson (7) and Taylor (8), -- is still heavy, still enamored of great, big walls of deeply textured layers of sound. But this time, they&apos;ve approached their music with an eye towards stylistic expression that completely invalidates any and all comments about heavy metal clich&amp;eacute;s. Moreover, they&apos;ve continued the exploration of melody that began on their first record. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Songs like &quot;Sulfur&quot; and &quot;Psychosocial&quot; deliver crushing verses and bridges, but then explode into soaring choruses that provide a powerful showcase for Taylor&apos;s voice. The song &quot;Vendetta&quot; features a sleazy, rough-and-tumble kind of swagger, but still delivers Slipknot&apos;s trademark balls-out fury. And &quot;All Hope Is Gone&quot; just spews raw anger, aggression, hate and foulness that serves as a reminder to anyone still stupid enough to harbor doubts that Slipknot are experts at delivering pure, heavy-metal punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&apos;s our fourth album, and we wanted to do something different,&quot; says Gray. &quot;You can&apos;t put out the same record over and over again. At the same time, you can definitely still tell that this is &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt;.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&apos;m looking forward to the expressions on people&apos;s faces when they hear the new record,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;There&apos;s very, very heavy stuff on this album, and it&apos;s gonna blow people&apos;s minds. But I&apos;m also excited for them to see the stuff that&apos;s different on this album, the more experimental music. No one&apos;s going to expect it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the album&apos;s diversity comes from the band&apos;s new approach to writing and recording. Over the years, most of the members have worked on various side projects, none of which sound remotely like Slipknot. It&apos;s no surprise to find out that these efforts influenced the writing process. Perhaps even more importantly, All Hope Is Gone was the first album on which contributions came from nearly all the band members, with each person bringing his own unique voice to the mix.&amp;nbsp; The band co-produced the album with Dave Fortman.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I think everyone just went in with an open mind. We would always listen to everyone&apos;s ideas, and if they worked, they worked, if they didn&apos;t, they didn&apos;t,&quot; explains Gray. &quot;This time, we really tried to build off the ideas, really tried to work on them.&amp;nbsp; I think it helped that so many of us were able to spend time doing our own thing, too.&amp;nbsp; Just writing with different people really makes a difference in how you think about music. When we finally came together, we were able to bring that to the mix.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; also made the executive decision to abandon Los Angeles, where they had recorded previous records. Instead, they came back home and set up camp in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iowa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The differences were immediately apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;It gave us more time and energy to experiment in the studio.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was able to come up with more guitar sounds than ever,&amp;rdquo; says Root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the heart of &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; remains its music, its soul is planted firmly on stage. Today, &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt; are playing in sold-out arenas, but the band developed their talents by slogging it out in the Midwest, playing any show they could find. These were frequently one-off shows; the band would travel from their hometown of Des Moines to places like Omaha&amp;nbsp; and Chicago. &quot;There were never any actual tours in those days,&quot; says Thomson. &quot;Our shows were like sporting events: We&amp;rsquo;d put everything into them and then afterwards, we&apos;d be fucking exhausted. We weren&apos;t going to pile into a van -- all nine of us -- and then drive all night to the next show. We&apos;d have fallen asleep at the wheel and died.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Those early shows were rough, but I loved the small stage,&quot; says Gray. &quot;There was something intimate about it.&amp;nbsp; It was like an old-school punk show, which is what I grew up with.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t miss that shit at all,&quot; disagrees Thomson. &quot;It was 8,000 degrees, you&apos;re bumping into people, you&apos;re tripping over equipment. Those small stages have low ceilings, so the heat&apos;s trapped real low -- right at your head. Those shows are about survival, not about playing.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;As difficult as those early shows were for the band, they were just as challenging for whoever might be standing in the front row. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Shawn used to bring chop saws on stage to grind pipes for sparks,&quot; remembers Thomson. &quot;Once, a chunk broke off and sent a kid to the hospital.&amp;nbsp; But people who got hurt at our shows were cool about it -- we&apos;d follow them to the hospital and sign some shirts and shit. It was like, you know, no harm, no foul.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Everyone tried to control us, though,&quot; says Taylor.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Yeah, those fuckers,&quot; says Thomson. &quot;We&apos;d be on tour and fire marshals would show up with camcorders and accuse us of all kinds of crazy bullshit. They&apos;d say, &apos;We heard you set yourselves on fire.&apos; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Well&amp;hellip; okay, we&apos;d done that!&quot; Thomson continues, laughing. &quot;Sid and Clown would spray each other with lighter fluid and then they&apos;d pull out lighters. That got us in trouble. One promoter would call the next -- they&apos;d warn each other and they&apos;d hit us with &apos;do not&apos; lists. We were castrated.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Surviving for 10 years is an accomplishment for any band. With &lt;strong&gt;Slipknot&lt;/strong&gt;, it feels like some sort of miracle. Personalities frequently collide, side-projects abound, and on-stage fights are common. And yet, year after year, album after album, all nine men keep coming back for more. &quot;We&apos;re banded together in hate,&quot; says Jordison. &quot;Sometimes we hate each other, sometimes we hate the world, sometimes we just hate our own lives. But when we get together, something monstrous happens and we pull this amazing sound out of all that energy.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Plus,&quot; he adds, &quot;we believe in world domination, and this is the band that&apos;s gonna get us there.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;You know, we went from being some local band in a basement to selling millions of records,&quot; says Gray. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a decade since the first album came out. I&apos;m so happy and amazed and proud and thankful for where this band has gone. I&apos;ve gotten to see the world -- and I get paid for it! I&apos;d have done it for free.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Chris Fehn agrees. &quot;I think the best part about being in this band has been getting exposure to the rest of the world. You realize that everything in the world is the same -- people feel the same, they have the same desires, hopes, fears. Being worldly is a gift that I don&apos;t ever want to give back. It changes your life -- especially when you&apos;re from a small town in Iowa.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I always knew we&apos;d go far. I just knew it,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;There was no way this band was going to fail. But I never knew we&apos;d reach the heights we&apos;ve come to. We&apos;ve traveled the world so many times; all the different countries are like our second homes. To this day, it still blows me away that we took this crazy idea and made it a global sensation.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Hope Is Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; will be released on Roadrunner Records on August 26th.&lt;br /&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;Soulfly&apos;s seventh album, &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;, stands steeped in tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available May 2010, frontman Max Cavalera fuels &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; with the same blood, fire and spirit that made him a genre icon with Sepultura, Soulfly and Cavalera Conspiracy. Following the warpath left by 2008&apos;s critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Conquer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; is a sign of Soulfly becoming an even fiercer, fierier and more furious metallic monster, seven albums into their storied career. Various Soulfly traditions remain upheld over the course of the album&apos;s 11 tracks. Bobby Burns&apos; bass rumbles and roars on teeth-gnashing opener &quot;Bloodbath and Beyond,&quot; as Joe Nunez commences pure percussive pummeling. Marc Rizzo tears through throat-slitting leads, while still making room to groove on the likes of &quot;Lethal Injection.&quot; Max&apos;s unmistakable vocals and riffs work in tandem for the ultimate aural assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max and Co. simply don&apos;t stop. Soulfly&apos;s Gold-certified, self-titled debut, has become a genre classic since its 1998 release. Six records and countless sold out shows across the world have paved the path for &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;. For Max, his latest Soulfly offering is the culmination of over a decade of growth. He explains, &quot;We entered a heavier and more aggressive phase with &lt;em&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Conquer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; is really violent in terms of the lyrics and the music. I think this record brings fans closer to Soulfly than ever before. It&apos;s got every element that people loved from the last two albums. It&apos;s all there, but it goes beyond that. People that liked &lt;em&gt;Conquer&lt;/em&gt; are going to love &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; because there are a couple more surprises.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those surprises come in the form of very special guest appearances. In the past, Max has collaborated with everyone from Slipknot&apos;s Corey Taylor and Slayer&apos;s Tom Araya to Deftones&apos; Chino Moreno and Sean Lennon. He&apos;s opted for two more genre luminaries this time around. On &quot;Rise of the Fallen,&quot; Max trades schizophrenic vocal tirades with Dillinger Escape Plan&apos;s Greg Puciato.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I met Greg during a Deftones show in LA,&quot; says Max. &quot;I told him that he should drop by the studio if he wanted to sing something. He loved the song from the beginning, but he told me he wanted to make it epic. Greg did the chaotic, high-pitched, Dillinger Escape Plan vocals, but he also did some melodic vocals at the end that gave the track another dimension. The song blows me away, and it continues the tradition of Soulfly collaborations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for &quot;Lethal Injection,&quot; Max enlisted the help of an old friend, Prong&apos;s Tommy Victor. Max said, &quot;Tommy did a killer job on the vocals. I&apos;ve loved Prong since the early days. Prong was part of a Pantera tour Sepultura did. It&apos;s really cool that he&apos;s on this record now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most bands slow down with age&amp;mdash;not Soulfly. Seven records in and they still create chaos better than anyone in this century. &quot;Violence runs on all the tracks,&quot; offers Max. &quot;Murder is this record&apos;s state of mind&amp;mdash;from &apos;Bloodbath and Beyond&apos; to &apos;Jeffrey Dahmer.&apos; It&apos;s a really violent album. I always wanted to write a song about a serial killer. This was my chance. &apos;Jeffrey Dahmer&apos; has such a catchy chorus mentioning his name, and I can hear people singing that. &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; mostly came out of every day experience though. &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; is a mysterious name, and it can relate to a lot of different things. From the whole time we were in the studio, I knew the album was going to be called &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max recorded with producer Logan Mader [Cavalera Conspiracy, Gojira, Devildriver] at Edge of the Earth Studios in Hollywood. He entered Edge of the Earth with ten riffs and emerged with an explosive metal masterpiece. They didn&apos;t waste any time commencing destruction either, and the first track proves that. &quot;&apos;Bloodbath and Beyond&apos; is almost like a hardcore song. It could&apos;ve been an Agnostic Front song. From the first note, you know it&apos;s on. The beating starts at the beginning. There&apos;s no intro. The vocals, guitars and everything hit you at once,&amp;rdquo; Max explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;A really special collaboration also happened with Max&apos;s sons. As B-Sides, Soulfly re-recorded Sepultura classic &quot;Refuse/Resist&quot; with Zyon Cavalera and Exel&apos;s &quot;Your Life, My Life&quot; with Igor Cavalera (his son, not his brother!) &quot;It was cool to record the B-Sides with my kids. Zyon&apos;s heartbeat actually opens the original Sepultura record, &lt;em&gt;Chaos A.D.&lt;/em&gt; Now he got to record the song with me! Igor plays on an Exel cover that he picked. We always have my family involved on the albums, and this just takes it to the next level,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuing another legacy, Max takes listeners into different territory again on &quot;Soulfly 7.&quot; He continues, &quot;This &apos;Soulfly&apos; song came out really easily. I love what Marc did. It&apos;s almost like Jimi Hendrix-meets-U2-meets-The-Police. It stands out from the rest of the record because it&apos;s so clean. Everything else is really heavy and distorted. This has really clean guitars so it jumps out at you.&quot; It&apos;s another heavy psychedelic journey that&apos;s both spiritual and strangely soothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc&apos;s six-string experimentation also led to a unique solo on &quot;Rise of the Fallen&quot; and a pensive acoustic outro on &quot;Mega-Doom.&quot; Max lauds him saying, &quot;Marc is such an exciting guitar player. He blew me away again. Marc came up with crazy, electronic sounds. He makes the guitar sound like a computer or a cell phone. It&apos;s a bit influenced by Rage Against the Machine. The album is split between those noises and some incredible melodic solos. Marc really outdid himself on &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;All around, &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; functions as portent for Soulfly&apos;s future by drawing upon their past. &quot;This is Soulfly&apos;s seventh album. With Sepultura, I only did six albums. Soulfly survived the times. It survived the crisis. After it took off with the first record, I never stopped or looked back. I just kept going. We&apos;re going to the future with &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;. Metal is still alive and kicking. Because you get older, it doesn&apos;t mean you need to get boring. The older I get, the more psycho I get. The albums get heavier and more aggressive. That&apos;s the message of &lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt;. Music is all I know how to do. It&apos;s all I like to do. This album just reaffirms that I can keep rocking.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Omen&lt;/em&gt; signals a new chapter for Soulfly and heavy metal.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

Recorded at film producer George Lucas&apos; infamous studios at Skywalker Ranch, &lt;em&gt;BINGO! &lt;/em&gt;is the band&apos;s first studio album in 17 years. A true return to Miller&apos;s roots, BINGO! echoes his early years in the Chicago music scene and features carefully chosen and crafted tracks performed in distinctive Steve Miller Band fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;With the continuing evolution of the music industry and the new exciting opportunities that are available I feel this is a perfect time to strike out on my own and develop an imprint where I can have creative control over the future of my music. It is the right time for me to establish new innovative partnerships in the industry and I am looking forward to a long relationship with Roadrunner / Loud &amp;amp; Proud&quot; says Miller of the new endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reaction from fans and industry insiders are comparing the album to Miller&apos;s 1968 masterpiece &lt;em&gt;SAILOR&lt;/em&gt;. BINGO!, will be the first of two albums that were recorded together as a complete body of work, the second of which will be offered next year via the new label partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After many years of discussion and sharing ideas, the time has finally arrived for Loud &amp;amp; Proud and Steve Miller to work together,&quot; commented Loud &amp;amp; Proud President Tom Lipsky. &quot;We are proud to be Steve&apos;s global label partner and excited to be involved with this landmark project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Steve Miller Band is one of the biggest selling recording, touring and catalog artists of all time, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide throughout its career. SMB&apos;s Greatest Hits 74-78 compilation reached prestigious Diamond Award certification with sales of more than 13 million units sold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roadrunner Records President Jonas Nachsin comments &quot;Loud &amp;amp; Proud has been gaining serious momentum in the past few months and now boasts a substantial roster with the addition of the incredible Steve Miller Band. Roadrunner is thrilled to be marketing an artist of Steve&apos;s legendary status along with our own diverse rock roster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;BINGO! was co-produced by Andy Johns (Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Van Halen), with artwork designed by the legendary Storm Thorgerson. These recordings feature longtime Steve Miller Band member Norton Buffalo, who sadly passed away in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;When we last saw Stone Sour, the triple-Grammy nominated group was playing sold-out shows around the planet in support of 2006&amp;rsquo;s critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Come What(ever) May&lt;/em&gt;, a sonic blockbuster that entered &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s Top 200 Album Chart at No. 4 and went on to sell more than a half-million copies on the strength of three radio hits, including the No. 1 smash single, &quot;Through Glass.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; hailed the record as &amp;ldquo;an intense, taut piece of work,&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Alternative Press &lt;/em&gt;called the group &amp;ldquo;masters of ass-kicking,&amp;rdquo; adding,&amp;rdquo; In a better America, Stone Sour would be the face of American rock,&amp;rdquo; and &lt;em&gt;Revolver&lt;/em&gt; magazine gave the disc four stars and praised the quintet for &amp;ldquo;demonstrating a dynamic range equaled by few of their peers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years later, the quintet (vocalist Corey Taylor, guitarists James Root and Josh Rand, bassist Shawn Economaki and drummer Roy Mayorga) have returned with a broadened range, a deepened perspective and the determination to make new album &lt;em&gt;AUDIO SECRECY&lt;/em&gt; a multi-layered record free of stylistic limitations. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s everything I&apos;ve ever wanted to do on one album,&amp;rdquo; says Taylor. &amp;ldquo;It&apos;s heavy, it&apos;s melodic, it&amp;rsquo;s dark, it&amp;rsquo;s slow, it&amp;rsquo;s light and it&amp;rsquo;s beautiful. You&amp;rsquo;ll hear something different with each listen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group recorded &lt;em&gt;AUDIO SECRECY&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Come What(ever) May&lt;/em&gt; producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Alice In Chains, Deftones) at Nashville&amp;rsquo;s Blackbird Studios. When they weren&amp;rsquo;t working on the album, they spent their free time living in a spook-filled crashpad. &quot;That house put us through hell,&amp;rdquo; laughs Taylor. &amp;ldquo;It was really old, so everything was broken down and leaking and infested with wasps and spiders. I&apos;d get lost because there were so many damn rooms. It was like living in the Haunted Mansion at Disney World. It did keep us in the right mood, though, so maybe we should thank it in the liner notes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone Sour does a lot of things brilliantly&amp;mdash;and they do most of them on &lt;em&gt;AUDIO SECRECY&lt;/em&gt;, beginning with &amp;ldquo;Mission Statement,&amp;rdquo; an electrifying track that breaks from the gate with white-knuckle intensity. &amp;ldquo;It punches you in the face and drags you by the hair like a caveman,&quot; laughs Taylor. Prior to the album&amp;rsquo;s release, the band offered &amp;ldquo;Mission Statement&amp;rdquo; as a free download. Fans responded en masse and the track was downloaded more than a 1,000 times an hour within a two day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among &lt;em&gt;AUDIO SECRECY&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s endless highlights is &amp;ldquo;Say You&amp;rsquo;ll Haunt Me,&amp;rdquo; a heavy-with-melody rock track that best exemplifies the band&amp;rsquo;s ability to pull in fans from cross-pollinating directions. At the album&amp;rsquo;s centerpiece is &amp;ldquo;Hesitate,&amp;rdquo; an epic &amp;ldquo;November Rain&amp;rdquo;-ish type track that&amp;rsquo;s both melodic and melancholic with orchestral strings and a soaring chorus. About the song&amp;rsquo;s emotion, Taylor says, &amp;ldquo;Lyric-wise, I&amp;rsquo;m writing from a more personal space here. Whether talking about a relationship or being a father or finding my soul mate, I&amp;rsquo;m putting it out there for everyone to hear and feel and see if anybody can relate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album&amp;rsquo;s title is a play on words for idiosyncrasy. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of double meanings and metaphorical speak,&amp;rdquo; muses Taylor. &amp;ldquo;There are so many levels to what those two words combined could mean. As a title, it perfectly fit the album.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;For guitarist Josh Rand, the track &amp;ldquo;The Pessimist&amp;rdquo; holds a special significance. &quot;It&apos;s the heaviest song we&apos;ve done up to this point. I spent a day and a half studying the Hindu scale for the lead. The guitar solo for that song has a very Eastern sound.&quot;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The song sees Rand shredding with a precise, powerful solo that&apos;s melodic and metallic. All the while, it preserves a unique feel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The great thing about Stone Sour is that we&amp;rsquo;ve got five writers in the band and the sound is like different pieces of cloth coming together to form a blanket,&quot; says Taylor. &quot;All you have to do is pull the strings a little tighter to bring those pieces together. Everyone in the band brought in material and we came up with an album that&apos;s really alive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Threadbare&quot; was written by Mayorga and marks a songwriting debut for the drummer. &quot;The band was really cool and encouraged me to throw some music into the hat,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s one of the longer, weirder and darker tracks on the record. I&apos;m thrilled everyone embraced it and made it a Stone Sour song. It&apos;s very progressive, and it makes for a nice little rollercoaster ride.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economaki goes deeper into the track, adding, &quot;It&apos;s absolutely epic. It&apos;s got clean melodies and it modulates. It takes the listener to a whole different dimension.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Stone Sour&apos;s trademark dual guitar assault became even tougher with Jim Root and Josh recording simultaneously. There was no need for them to over-digitize parts or go back and water everything down with Pro Tools. Taking an old school approach, both guitarists entered the booth and ripped away. Says Rand, &quot;We&apos;re like five guys playing in a garage and it reflects in the music. There&apos;s a song for every mood you can possibly go through in a day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This album really represents everything we&amp;rsquo;ve been threatening to do,&amp;rdquo; says Taylor. &amp;ldquo;It has so many different vibes and styles&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s probably the best thing I&amp;rsquo;ve done in a long time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a helluva statement considering Taylor&amp;rsquo;s resume, which includes his &amp;ldquo;other gig&amp;rdquo; as the lead singer of multi-platinum Grammy winning band Slipknot (Root also pulls double-duty, playing guitar for both groups).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&apos;m not trying to change the world, I just want to make music and get some shit off my chest,&amp;rdquo; smiles Taylor. &amp;ldquo;But at the end of the day, I hope people dig this record. I hope they grab onto something that they want to sing all day. I hope it gets them excited. I hope it makes them think and I hope it makes them want to start their own bands. I hope it makes them happy and most important of all, I hope they feel that it was worth the wait.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;p&gt;The members of Taking Dawn grew up surrounded by the glitz and glam, the bright lights and big city of constant vice. This LasVegas upbringing helped shaped the band into what it is today: a rock &apos;n roll timebomb just waiting to explode on an unsuspecting public with its Roadrunner debut, &lt;em&gt;Time to Burn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve spent our whole lives in Las Vegas and we&apos;re the only people from Las Vegas who didn&apos;t turn into smack dealers,&quot; says vocalist/guitarist Chris Babbitt, showcasing his signature humor. Babbitt and guitarist Mikey Cross were born at the same hospital and brought into this world by the same doctor. It&apos;s as though the stars were aligned and the duo were &lt;em&gt;destined&lt;/em&gt; to be in a band.&amp;nbsp; Babbitt recalls the band&apos;s coming together, saying, &quot;Alan and I met sophomore year in high school when I started playing guitar. I met Mike senior year, after I had been trying to put a band together for many years and it finally happened when we were 21.&quot; Babbitt fell into the frontman role, in what turns out to have been a happy accident. &quot;No one could sing so I was going to have to step it up. Everyone sucked and I happened to suck less,&quot; he says, tongue planted firmly in cheek. Babbitt admits the band started &quot;screwing around&quot; at a local haunt &amp;ndash; Roberto&apos;s Taco Shop&amp;mdash; and everything spiraled from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babbitt and Cross also worked security at the Hard Rock Hotel, which helped them remain surrounded by and immersed in rock &apos;n roll. This rough &apos;n tumble day job led the duo to appear as the star security guards on True TV&apos;s &lt;em&gt;Rehab &lt;/em&gt;show.&amp;nbsp; Babbitt laughs about his role on the reality show, saying, &quot;I save a lot of lives, kick a lot of ass!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;One other way Taking Dawn kicks a lot of ass is in their band. &quot;All the glitz and being immersed by constant vice has steered us in the other direction,&quot; Babbitt admits. &quot;We don&apos;t drink a lot, smoke or do drugs. We&apos;re just about the music and the girls that come with it!&quot; While most of the members were just born when Guns N&apos; Roses was tearing up the Sunset Strip in L.A., Taking Dawn got up to speed and on the quick, with their steadfast rock &apos;n roll dedication and education. Chris&apos; dad was a rocker and a hippie, and his son was predisposed to a life of loving Black Sabbath and Deep Purple. &quot;He played Sabbath while he vacuumed around my crib. When I got picked up from kindergarten, he&apos;d ask me what track was playing,&quot; he remembers. Babbitt also learned to love the rock early and that&apos;s something he&apos;s taken with him into his &apos;20s and within his local scene.&amp;nbsp; He says, &quot;Las Vegas is represented by The Killers and Panic At The Disco. There is no real rock &apos;face&apos; here anymore. Slaughter was the last rock band, so I feel like we have a lot to carry on that end, as a rock band, to bring attention to the scene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Taking Dawn are by no means a throwback to 80s glam metal, the band is certainly inspired by the era gone by and have chosen to take the foundation of that sound and scene and update it in a thoroughly modern way: by shredding, soloing and creating melody in their music.&amp;nbsp; &quot;I don&amp;rsquo;t get people who don&apos;t like Bon Jovi and Skid Row and other classic bands,&quot; he says.&amp;nbsp; &quot;We want to bring it to the kids, for them to understand it in a modern context. We don&apos;t want to imitate. We want to do our own thing. We want the balls and the attitude.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Time To Burn &lt;/em&gt;has the desired cojones and a whole lotta attitude.&amp;nbsp; The title track was the one that attracted the attention of Roadrunner, due to the fact that it&apos;s fast, oozes energy and makes a big statement. &quot;It goes, &apos;Homicidal, kill your idols / Your heroes are whores and your only God is you.&apos; It&apos;s a big statement about what we want to say. We don&apos;t want to look like &quot;some&quot; part or image and we&apos;re saying you don&apos;t have to do drugs and be complete fuck up to still rock harder than the rest of them.&quot; Amen to that!&amp;nbsp; The band is particularly proud of the song, saying,&amp;nbsp; &quot;We can write an aggressive, catchy song that shreds.&quot; The song even has a part where the band sings, &apos;Halle-Fucking-lujah.&apos;&amp;nbsp; Of that moment, Babbitt offers further explanation, saying, &quot;It builds differently, instead of being the same formulaic, pseudo-anti-establishment and anti-organized religion song. It has religious innuendo. You know, it&apos;s the one word Ozzy never said! I needed one word he didn&apos;t already use. It&apos;s liberating and fun as fuck to sing. We almost didn&apos;t keep that part but it&apos;s the hook of the song.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Take Me Away&quot; is a playful romp about a lady of the night, so to speak, and sonically, it lives at the other end of the spectrum of the band&apos;s style: it has a metallic edge dosed with the catchy pop the band cops to liking. &quot;We like songs that are classics and that have hooks. We want to connect with people,&quot; Babbitt says.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Everyone agrees on the same top 50 songs that make up the musical canon. We want to slide into that 50. This song is rock &apos;n roll with the baddest guitars around and it&apos;s catchier than herpes.&quot; While it&apos;s a bold statement for the band to make, it&apos;s hard to argue with confidence and bravado when there is talent and skill to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band also shows off its non-standard side by covering Fleetwood Mac&apos;s &quot;The Chain.&quot; They originally planned to do their own rendition of WASP&apos;s &quot;Fuck Like a Beast,&quot; but decided to switch gears. Babbitt says, &quot;We wanted to do something more ambitious, even though that song summed up the band and we want to give that song limelight. Then we started thinking of alternatives and we didn&apos;t want to be pigeonholed by the 80s scene even though we love bands from that era. Mike was rolling through songs and that is our favorite Fleetwood Mac song. We have the opportunity to do what Metallica did for &apos;Turn the Page&apos; and make it our own while retaining the original audience.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band demoed with Jason Suecof (Trivium, All That Remains) and eventually recorded with Elvis Baskette (Chevelle, Incubus). In the end, Babbitt wants to write songs that sound like Randy Rhoads meets Marty Friedman, merging the classic rock and modern metal sounds into their own unique blend.&amp;nbsp; He admits, &quot;We&apos;re not trying to write other people&apos;s songs. We&apos;re trying to write songs that kick your fucking ass but have a vintage feel.&quot; He also eschews genre classification, saying, &quot;Our music is about attitude and being open to rocking out to a song. That goes far for us. The genre barrier bullshit is not for us. You can do both. You don&apos;t have to be a savior or a martyr. That kills music.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genres, compartmentalization and safe rock &apos;n roll be damned.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             &lt;strong&gt;Theory of a Deadman&lt;/strong&gt; had a simple but daunting goal for its third album:  to make the greatest record possible. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&quot;I always try to remind the guys and myself that there are 20 bands lined up behind us just waiting for a chance to take our place,&quot; says frontman Tyler Connolly.  &quot;So that means we had to go in there and make a great record.&quot; With &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the Vancouver trio has hit its mark.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The balanced 13-track effort is the polished and passionate testament to seven years of hard work, heavy touring and diligent attention to its craft. From the swirling grind of &quot;By the Way&quot; to the nasty snarl of &quot;Crutch&quot; to the soaring melodicism of &quot;Not Meant to Be&quot; and &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is a broad-reaching endeavor that puts Connolly, guitarist Dave Brenner and bassist Dean Back high in the rock pantheon, achieving creative growth without sacrificing the hard-hitting power that got them here in the first place.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&quot;We really dug hard on this one,&quot; Connolly notes. &quot;The longer you&apos;re in a band, the more you write songs, the better you get. We&apos;ve had such a great opportunity to figure out what to do better, how to write a better song and keep building and building. That&apos;s exciting for us.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; began taking shape in February of 2007, as Theory was winding down from touring to support its second album, 2005&apos;s Gasoline, a slump-defying sophomore outing that launched the hits &quot;No Surprise,&quot; &quot;Say Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Santa Monica&quot; and &quot;Hello Lonely (Walk Away From This).&quot; The group returned to Grammy-nominated producer Howard Benson, who in turn issued marching orders that set the tone for the project. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&quot;Before we even went into the studio, Howard wanted to gear this record up to sound huge,&quot; Connolly recalls about Benson&apos;s &quot;all killer, no filler&quot; approach to the record. &quot;He said, &amp;lsquo;You have to go into a record with great songs. You can&apos;t make them while you&apos;re there. You can&apos;t just go in with one or two great songs. You&apos;ve got to have 10.&apos; So we just kept sending him songs until we had the 10 to 12 great ones, and then he said, &apos;OK, let&apos;s go.&apos;&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Theory actually brought about 17 songs to Los Angeles&apos; Bay 7 studios in August of 2007. Amidst low-key hijinks -- Brenner and Back grew mustaches, Connolly sported a fake one in the name of band unity -- the group and studio drummer Robin Diaz recorded 15 before choosing the 12 that ultimately comprise Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs, which proved an apt title for the range of emotions Connolly sings about on the album.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&apos;s the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of your life,&quot; he explains. &quot;The songwriting on the record is really about someone&apos;s past or and present, their relationships and how they shape everything. It&apos;s more metaphorical than physical scars and trophies.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And while Connolly has certainly done his turn as a rock &apos;n&apos; roll king of pain on Gasoline and 2002&apos;s attention-catching debut Theory Of A Deadman, he went into &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; determined to show he could be more than the &quot;callous bastard&quot; Rolling Stone magazine called him in an early profile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Connolly explores broad new lyrical terrain, indicative of his growth as a person and as songwriter. &quot;For awhile there, every song was, &apos;Get the f*&amp;amp;k out! I don&apos;t need women! Screw them!&apos; That&apos;s kinda how I felt at that point,&quot; Connolly says with a self-effacing laugh. &quot;But I&apos;ve grown as a songwriter, and as a person. I wanted to write some different, nicer songs for a change.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He didn&apos;t have to look hard for inspiration. He wrote &quot;Wait For Me,&quot; with its acoustic guitar underpinning and rich chorus, for his wife, paying tribute to her fortitude in being home alone while he&apos;s on the road. The piano-laden &quot;All or Nothing,&quot; meanwhile, chronicles their relationship, which began as a good friendship before blossoming into romance. &quot;It was kind of sick of me writing all these woman-hater songs before,&quot; acknowledges Connolly, whose mother left his family when he was in high school, providing rich source material for his earlier work. &quot;People thought I was writing about my wife.&quot; While Connolly&apos;s lyrics have taken on a kinder, gentler pallor on &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the band continues to keep the knobs cranked to 11. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Connolly also went into &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; trying to write some songs that were &quot;just for fun,&quot; and succeeded with tracks such as &quot;End of Summer,&quot; an anthem about the bittersweetness of endings, whether that of a season or a relationship.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But even though the album mines a deeper emotional trough, it charges with the same potent force of its predecessors. When fans eagerly crank up the likes of &quot;So Happy,&quot; &quot;Got it Made&quot; and  &quot;Bad Girlfriend,&quot; they&apos;ll end up with a set of blown out speakers, thanks to the firepower that crackles in these rockers, while &quot;Sacrifice&quot; bristles with the kind of primal, super-charged defiance that has long defined the best hard rock. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&quot;A lot of bands, they grow older and they get grayer and they just can&apos;t do the rock songs anymore,&quot; Connolly says. &quot;I don&apos;t see that happening to us. Fans are gonna hear our record and hear some softer stuff, but we&apos;re a rock band. I think it sounds bigger than the other two (albums) we&apos;ve done.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Which is, not surprisingly, why Connolly, Brenner and Back are chomping at the bit to take &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; out on the road. &quot;We really want to take the band farther this time,&quot; Connolly says. &quot;We want to get out there to places we have not been before - where a lot of our fans are --Asia, Australia, as well as reaching our fans in North America and Europe. We&apos;re just a hard-working band, man. We want to be out there for a couple of years and play these songs to everybody we possibly can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an album like &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scars &amp;amp; Souvenirs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the fans will be lining up to listen.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                             As the years fly by at breath-stealing speed, the aim of every self-respecting metal band must surely be to stake a claim for immortality; to carve their name with pride into metal&apos;s metaphorical Mount Rushmore. In the modern era, as countless new (and not so new) bands jostle for position at the front of the grid, it becomes ever harder to pick the wheat from the chaff, the weak from the strong. But amid such a swarm of mediocrity, the greatest bands always rise effortlessly to the top, building in confidence and momentum with each incremental step forward, learning from their mistakes, gaining nourishment and focus from their triumphs and growing, with gathering speed, into something that truly matters. It&apos;s 2008 and Trivium fit that description perfectly. One listen to their jaw-dropping new album, the mighty Shogun, will be all the convincing you need that their time has arrived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We wrote this album exactly the way we all wanted to,&quot; says frontman Matt Heafy. &quot;We really did our own thing this time. When people check it out, they&apos;ll realize that we&apos;re not an exclusive band. We&apos;re not doing this for one specific kind of person. If you want to come to a show and rock out, that&apos;s what we&apos;re here for. We&apos;re just four normal guys who just happen to be able to play metal for lots of cool people around the world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt; story began in earnest with the release of their &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner &lt;/strong&gt;debut, 2005&apos;s Ascendancy album; the perfect way to introduce the band - Heafy, guitarist Corey Beaulieu, bassist Paolo Gregoletto and drummer Travis Smith - to a newly revitalized global metal scene.  The album exhibited great depth and musicality, and immediately set the band apart from the pack, turning them into one of the most widely hailed bands the genre had produced in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US,  Europe, Japan and Australia - and particularly in the UK, where Trivium shot from nowhere to conquering the annual Download Festival at Castle Donington and becoming a major headlining act - Heafy and co. were making major waves, touring relentlessly around the globe and building up a huge international fan base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released in the autumn of 2006 - a mere 18 months after its predecessor - &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt;&apos;s second &lt;strong&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/strong&gt; release &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crusade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was a massive milestone; a bold, and adventurous move that both consolidated their reputation as metal&apos;s fastest rising young band and proved that unlike their peers, &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt; were more than happy to take a few risks in order to further nurture their art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buoyed by critical acclaim, a hugely positive response from the fans and a seemingly never-ending stream of high profile tours, including a successful cross-Europe joint as special guests to Iron Maiden and a triumphant stint on the Ozzfest tour in the US, &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt; quickly threw themselves into the writing process for Shogun, spending many on-the-road hours honing and refining their newest material in anticipation of hitting the studio, this time with renowned producer Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters/Stone Sour/Death Angel).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were writing on tour for a year straight,&quot; says Heafy. &quot;When we were on the Black Crusade tour in Australia, I showed the &lt;strong&gt;Machine Head&lt;/strong&gt; guys the songs. I respect Robb Flynn such an incredible amount as a musician and a person and I wanted to know what he thought. He called me up and gave me a really good talk about demoing and revisiting songs and all that, so we went back to the rehearsal studio and completely re-wrote everything. Then we sent the stuff to Nick, and then between us we picked the 13 best songs. We went to Franklin, Tennessee, where we lived for eight weeks, and recorded at Sound Kitchen Studios. It&apos;s a legendary country music studio where Willie Nelson recorded. Everyone was amazing and so nice, so it was a great working environment for us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a moment for every great band when everything comes together and a definitive musical identity emerges. For &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt;, this is it. The collaboration with Raskulinecz has taken &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt; to new compositional and technical levels, while the album&apos;s brutal, bone-shattering production means that they&apos;ve never sounded heavier or more powerful. With lashings of vicious riffs that celebrate the band&apos;s love of death, black and thrash metal, alongside the most incisive and memorable melodies the quartet have ever written, Shogun is a monstrous achievement that promises to have the cynics and naysayers choking on their toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was all very natural,&quot; explains Heafy. &quot;We didn&apos;t care what was going to come out, and that&apos;s why it sounds this way. We all still love extremely heavy music with the brutality and no melody, but we also love stuff that&apos;s incredibly melodic and simple and memorable, so that explains the two extremes. We like to have everything. Vocally we tried everything from the lowest note I can sing to the highest note, from the lowest growl to the highest scream, and everything in between. We wanted to try it all. That was the whole concept behind the record. No limits!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shogun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is not a concept album in the traditional sense, the influence of Heafy&apos;s own Japanese background - its warrior culture, its strong sense of pride - is present through every last second of these powerful, emotive metal anthems. Both opener &quot;Kirisute Gomen&quot; and the album&apos;s mighty 12-minute title track are perfect examples of this, as Heafy explains. &quot; &amp;lsquo;Kirisute Gomen&quot; was an ancient Samurai code that basically meant that if you angered a Samurai or pissed them off, they&apos;d have to chop your head off,&quot; states Heafy. &quot;It was like the martial law of the Samurai. The title of the album came to me when we were on our second tour of Japan, and I was on a bus tour and they were talking about how the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shogun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were the highest ranking military generals. It was the coolest name I&apos;d ever heard before, so I knew I&apos;d use it for something some day. When we started writing this music and I heard how epic it all was, I said to the guys &amp;lsquo;I&apos;ve had this title in my head for ages, how do you think it&apos;d work as the title of the album?&apos; and they loved it too. The definition of the word just commands strength and it feels powerful, so it was perfect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside tales of ancient Japan, the album also delves into the brain-boggling world of ancient Greek mythology, with songs like &quot;Torn Between Scylla And Charybdis&quot; and &quot;Of Prometheus And The Crucifix&quot; revelling in the imagery and drama of symbolic sagas first told many thousands of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;When you look at something like religion, people seem to take those stories as true events that really happened,&quot; states Heafy. &quot;With mythology, everyone knew these were stories created, and used them as ways to help live their lives better or to help them to cope with things. So I&apos;ve used those myths as a tool to help further develop the lyrics.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt; have been threatening to make that final leap from established contenders to full-on metal heroes for the last few years, and with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shogun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, their fourth and manifestly best album to date, they have clearly mastered the metal arts and are ready to step into the arena with the genre&apos;s greats. From the bludgeoning bombast of &quot;Kirisute Gomen&quot; through to the hook-laden savagery of &quot;Down From The Sky&quot; and &quot;Into The Mouth Of Hell We March&quot;, and on to the towering steel-plated genius of &quot;Shogun&quot; itself, this is truly &lt;strong&gt;Trivium&lt;/strong&gt;&apos;s defining album and the first stone-cold classic of their career. With over 800 live shows under their belt to date, Florida&apos;s finest are ready to hit the road again and this time they have both the songs and the self-belief to take on all-comers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This first shows we do for this album are gonna be just us, our instruments and the music,&quot; says Heafy with obvious pride. &quot;There&apos;s not going to be any fancy shit going on. It&apos;s just gonna be raw, brutal and exactly what this album is. It&apos;s about the music, and that&apos;s all we&apos;re about. We hope everyone comes out to see us and we hope you all dig the record. We&apos;re really proud of it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shogun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is set for release on September 30th.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

     <string>                               &lt;p&gt;With the rise of gothic metal, dozens of bands have combined crunchy power chord volleys with ethereal vocals and orchestral arrangements, but none have done so as convincingly or with such a keen grasp for symphonic arrangements as Holland&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Within Temptation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Formed by chanteuse &lt;strong&gt;Sharon den Adel&lt;/strong&gt; and guitarist &lt;strong&gt;Robert Westerholt&lt;/strong&gt; in 1996, Within Temptation have become superstars across Europe over the course of three studio albums. Now, with a new deal with Roadrunner Records and their epic new album, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heart of Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the band seems destined bring its majestic, emotion-swept music to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We pushed ourselves to make these songs the best that we could,&amp;quot; says Westerholt of the new record. &amp;quot;We wanted to have a more organic feeling and more energy than ever. I think our last one, [2004&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Silent Force&lt;/em&gt;], went a bit too far in one direction; at times the orchestra pushed away the drums and guitars. This time we tried to get the guitars more prominent and have more riffs. It still has a big feeling and there&amp;#39;s still plenty of classical parts, but I think we did it without losing the power of the band.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heart of Everything&lt;/em&gt;, Within Temptation has never sounded more powerful or alive. The first single &amp;quot;What Have You Done,&amp;quot; featuring &lt;strong&gt;Keith Caputo&lt;/strong&gt; of Life of Agony, which see-saws between caustic guitar crunch and gothy, gauzy textures, is the perfect marriage of melodic rock and metal. The equally powerful track &amp;quot;The Howling&amp;quot; showcases Den Adel&amp;#39;s trademark haunting vocals and soaring melodies, while the glacial &amp;quot;Frozen,&amp;quot; features heartrending vocals and staccato string bursts and &amp;quot;The Cross&amp;quot; which starts like an intro to a film score, segues into a winding, dramatic number that&amp;#39;s equal parts Richard Wagner, The Gathering and Kate Bush.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our biggest goal besides writing the best songs we can was to give this record more energy than the last one,&amp;quot; says singer Sharon den Adel. &amp;quot;I used my voice in a different way on every song. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s high and melodic, almost classical, and in some songs it&amp;#39;s lower with power.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We made very careful choices when we were writing these songs,&amp;quot; adds Westerholt. &amp;quot;We didn&amp;#39;t use orchestra everywhere and we also cut down a bit in the layering of the arrangements so they were more efficient and had less choruses so they could work better together with the band.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While Within Temptation was more selective about their compositions and less effusive with their classical elements, they experimented as much as ever, adding mandolin to &amp;quot;The Cross,&amp;quot; cello to four tracks and working with the Prague Orchestra instead of individual players or synthetic strings. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We like to try different things and when we&amp;#39;re writing a song, we never know where that inspiration comes from,&amp;quot; adds Den Adel. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s always very spontaneous and that&amp;#39;s what makes the music unique.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The band chose the album title &lt;em&gt;The Heart of Everything&lt;/em&gt; because the songs address feelings and ideas that exist under the surface and can&amp;#39;t be excavated without introspection. &amp;quot;So often, we live our lives without thinking,&amp;quot; Westerholt explains. &amp;quot;We just do things because we&amp;#39;re born in a certain environment and people are expecting certain things from you. Sometimes its important to look within yourself and discover what really makes you happy and what&amp;#39;s important to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In their search for self-discovery, Within Temptation address a variety of subjects, including the futility of war (&amp;quot;Our Solemn Hour&amp;quot;), the strength of unconditional love (&amp;quot;Forgiven&amp;quot;) and personal hardships faced by certain bandmembers (&amp;quot;The Cross&amp;quot;). Books inspired some tracks, like &amp;quot;Hand of Sorrow.&amp;quot; Others were based on films. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We wrote &amp;lsquo;The Heart of Everything&amp;#39; after watching &amp;lsquo;Braveheart,&amp;#39; says Westerholt. &amp;quot;And &amp;lsquo;The Truth Beneath the Rose&amp;#39; is based on &amp;lsquo;The Da Vinci Code&amp;#39; and is about the idea that belief is sometimes used to justify sins. On the other hand, it may be more important with belief that it&amp;#39;s your own belief and you can stand behind it instead of following the belief other people may want to put upon you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within Temptation started writing the new songs at the end of 2005 and fine-tuned the material until late 2006. &amp;quot;We take our time to make our record,&amp;quot; explains Den Adel. &amp;quot;We are not easily satisfied with ourselves, and the recording process is very time consuming because we record many instruments and sounds on our record beside the usual band stuff.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Actually, this was our fastest follow-up,&amp;quot; adds Westerholt. &amp;quot;So I think this was our easiest album to do. However, no album is ever really easy because there are big ups and downs in the writing and recording process. But in comparison to the other ones, this one felt the best.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With good reason. &lt;em&gt;The Heart of Everything&lt;/em&gt; recaptures everything Within Temptation has thrived upon while taking their music to newer, more thrilling places. And in the process, through all the melancholy atmospheres, cinematic riffs and angelic vocals, the band delivers its most pragmatic and proactive message to date. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you want to make something out of your life, it&amp;#39;s in your own hands,&amp;quot; Westerholt says. &amp;quot;Life can sometimes be pretty rough and not very easy, but still you have a lot of power within yourself and there&amp;#39;s always the possibility to bend things your own way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;    </string>
